Complex Integration of Multiple Brain Systems was developed by **Beatriz Sheldon, MEd, and Albert Sheldon, MD**. A novel and innovative therapeutic paradigm, CIMBS provides many practical and understandable explanations for the complexity of our emotions and emotional behaviors. This practical knowledge can be useful to any person whether they are part of the helping professions or not, and goes hand in hand with mindful approaches to life and to all forms of treatment. It integrates knowledge from various fields such as neuroscience, attachment theory, affect regulation, developmental psychology, and mindfulness practices. CIMBS is the love child of two conventionally trained therapists that felt the need to break away from the mainstream, and even popular alternative, approaches towards therapeutic practice. They felt that they had much more to offer their clients than the support they were able to provide even after many years of training, finding what was existent to be too confining. Both of them felt that their creative energy and playful nature as a therpist was stifled 

Beatriz and Albert originally met at a scientific conference and found an immediate synergy with one another(bow chicka bow-wow). They came from different cultures, backgrounds, and therapeutic trainings, but were able to find an ability to channel wisdom which combined their diverse experiences. They had a shared ability to see therapeutic phenomenon and opportunities that their colleagues did not. This synergy lead them to discover and uncover profound sources of energy and knowledge within their patients that were completely nonconscious and had escaped detection previously. The two of them experimented with interventions based on what was being observed, and at first, it seemed impossible to describe what they were discovering. Within the first 20 minutes of a therapy session, they could create remarkable changes in patients, observable moves forward which sustained between sessions. Trying to understand what was unfolding in the brains and minds of their patients, Beatriz and Albert turned to studying the science of neurobiology and affective neuroscience. What they found was both simple and profound. Neuroscience literature had revealed to them the existence of "brain systems," established neural circuits that perform dedicated physical and behavioral functions. By doing some digging, they were able to discover brain systems that appeared relevant to their patients strengths and difficulties. Some of the most important of these systems were operating mostly out of their patients awareness, aspects of their nonconscious, but were accessible to be worked with in treatment. Over time, they developed numerous practical ways to mobilize the energy and wisdom which was stored within these nonconscious emotional brain systems(which we are all born with). They found that by harnessing these many emotional brain systems, they could not only help provide treatment for their patients difficulties, but enable them to change the trajectory of their live. As they were working with patients, Beatriz and Albert were able to access their own nonconscious emotional brain systems, freeing themselves to become more fulfilled and effective in their work. 

After over two decades of practice and empirical clinical research, Beatriz and Albert expanded and organized their methodology into an innovative therapeutic paradigm that they call Complex Integration of Multiple Brain Systems, or CIMBS. Once one gets past the challenges of this novel approach, understanding and embracing the emotional brain systems, the effectiveness and potential of this model will become quite clear - unlocking a tremendous amount of energy. Here we will cover a few of the key structural elements of CIMBS, including the neurobiological nature of important emotional brain systems, how they interact with one another to develop adaptive and maladaptive behaviors, and how we can work with them to help patients/clients/ourselves heal.

CIMBS helps clients gain awareness of their present-moment experience, allowing for real-time integration of emotional, cognitive, and physiological processes. This focus on dynamic, moment-to-moment engagement is rare among therapeutic models. As I was going through the book, it was quite interesting to me that deep presence on the therapists part was one of the largest driving forces behind the models success. Through the cultivation of presence and awareness, traits which are heavily focused upon in Eastern Traditions, the therapist is able to use their focus like a laser beam to creatively untangle brain systems which are wired in an unsavory manner. This untangling then releases a tremendous amount of energy and reorganizes the structure of the brain in favorable ways. Is the disentanglement of hyper or hypo-neural subcortical brain regions similar to the releases of kundalini referenced to in the Eastern tradition of self actualization? 


In comparison to other models, CIMBS stands out as being at the forefront of integrating our most advanced scientific understanding of how the mind, body, and emotions work together. While other therapies incorporate aspects of science and neuroscience, CIMBS excels in utilizing every element of what we know to facilitate comprehensive healing and transformation. This makes it one of the most sophisticated approaches available today for working with complex psychological, emotional, and relational issues.
