One of the main inspirations for me to put this together was the recent death of Susan Jane Hall, a wonderful yoga instructor at the studio I frequent and someone I got to know a little bit over the last 3 years.

She had a band called “Bijaa,” and they were quite musically talented. Going to one of their kirtan events was my original introduction to mantra. Chanting those sounds, as silly and weird and foolish as I felt in the moment, completely evolved my life and brought me to a place unrecognizable to the situation I was in originally. Susan played a critical role, whether she knew it or not, in helping me along my kundalini awakening journey.

She was somewhat intense – prioritizing mastery, alignment, and adherence to the philosophy; not your average chill, good vibe, feel nice yoga gal. She cut through the B.S. and didn’t necessarily care if you liked her or not. It was as though she were the fiery energy of Kali, a major goddess in Hinduism, incarnate. After a long battle with cancer, Susan was believed to be in-remission. I may have been witness to the cause for its resurgence. In a turn of events, which I was not fully conscious of until thinking of what to say at a memorial held in her name, I will share this story with you to contemplate upon. A single moment, one which could have easily been overlooked and discounted, demonstrates the truth of a radically different take on our understanding of illness.

I was there the last night she taught. Sometimes being in her Yin class was a little scary, as though it were the 1950’s and your teacher would come slap your hands with a ruler if you were spacing out. I always felt somewhat on edge, in a way that made me more mindful. If you were even slightly off in your positioning, there was a good chance that she would make her way around the room and catch it. This was awesome, it helped me to see my blind-spots, and was the reason I loved coming to her classes. That really takes a lot of effort for a teacher, who could otherwise just do their own thing directing everyone through a flow and let you figure things out yourself. Towards the end however, it felt like she would sometimes get a little carried away. I’m a chronic perfectionist, and could recognize my incessant need for everything to always be done correctly reflected in her. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the movie Whiplash, but our shadows intermingled in a similar manner; myself as Miles Teller and her as J.K. Simmons(but lets turn down the intensity by 95% and replace mind-blowing drumming with fascia release). I was the student that was always ‘needing’ to improve and get better, to perfect the craft, and she was the wise instructor who could provide endless corrections and introduce new things. We weren’t necessarily Daniel San and Mr. Miyagi, but this was the very, very, subtle dynamic we had with one another. Susan was constantly in and out of the studio dealing with her illness, but was teaching when she felt up to it. After entering remission and being told that all the cancer was gone, she was starting to become more regular. There were a few good months here. During one particular Sunday night stretching session, I noticed that she was a little bit off. To be expected from someone in her circumstance, I didn’t necessarily think too much of it. She seemed like she was a little uptight, uncomfortable. At this point I had developed some mastery in the yogic process, overcame parts of my need for feeling all masterful, and was sometimes just looking to relax. I didn’t really give a hoot(or a holler) about doing the stretches all perfectly. I could if I really wanted to impress myself, but on this particular night, I was just trying to breathe and connect with my body – to enter the parasympathetic nervous system and that state of inner peace. Yoga was my choice modality to practice self therapy, not always the search to stretch fascia at perfect angles. Susan came around and gave me a correction. Of course, I’m always a little off, thank you! A few minutes later here she is again adjusting me once more. Damn I must be a little out of it tonight. Ok, I thought I was doing fine, maybe I’ve gotta pay a little more attention. But then, here she comes around for a third time – still within the first 20 minutes here mind-you, bringing me yet another modification – seeming a bit agitated at my inability to navigate the postures correctly. This one felt unnecessary, like she was needing to do this her own sake, to get a little boost from directing others around. The position I was guided into actually caused me some pain. I accidentally belted out a loud and bothered “OKAY” in response to her guidance for my legs new and improved location, which she had begun to impatiently position herself, exposing my overextended state to the whole studio. Oh yeah, EVERYONE in the room heard that one loud and clear. Am I really that out of control tonight, out here stretching in a repeatedly dangerous manner and yelling like a maniac, ruining everyone else’s experience? That would actually be kinda hilarious. Oh well, even if the worst possible situation here is true(me being unknowingly unhinged), it doesn’t really matter. I’m fine, people probably accidentally make loud noises in difficult positions all the time, this is yoga not a concert hall, we are all mature enough to move on and laugh about it at the end of the day. Ultimately, I didn’t really know with absolute certainty if I was the one leaking my inner stress and making a scene, or if she was being kinda weird. I thought that Susan would be able to recognize the fact that maaaybe she’s been doing a little too much here and partly, if not fully, drew that reaction out of me herself. With her being in recovery, I understood the situation and was completely let go from any sort of negativity towards her. Feeling as though it came across like an angry “I’m fed up with your attempts to correct and interrupt me old lady, I know what I’m doing here, leave me the hell alone!”, I began to feel somewhat bad. I really didn’t mean to vocalize so loudly, but couldn’t have prevented it. Later in the class, there was a position we were getting into that called for the use of a strap/belt to deepen into the stretch. During the transition, she said “raise your hand if you don’t have a strap and I’ll come bring you one.” I raised my hand, very clearly directing my gaze towards her, and it was as though she couldn’t bare to look at me. Susan didn’t bring me one, she was done assisting someone that wasn’t grateful for her efforts, but did make it to a few others. I sat there on the floor now exposed to the fact that she was in an activated state – perceiving me as some triggered princess that couldn’t take another persons advice, or maybe perhaps intimately aware of her own misdoings and too embarrassed to reconcile them in the moment. Passing her in the hallway with a smile and thanking her for the class, trying to quell any negative charge that may have bubbled up, she fully stopped for a moment and wished me one of the most genuine good night’s I have ever received. Her face looked somewhat perturbed, as if she was trying to process what had happened, a mix of confusion and guilt subtly etched into her expression. Her eyes seemed to reflect a moment of self-doubt, as though she was questioning her actions and feeling emotions about how she had interacted with me during the class. After that night, she didn’t show up to teach classes anymore. 2 months later she was dead.

After talking to others that were closer to her than myself, I discovered what had happened. Susan began to feel a cascade of pain and took time off. Things began to get progressively worse. She originally had Colon cancer and went through a surgery that opened her intestines, removed the tumor, and then sealed it all back up. After this, she did rounds of chemotherapy and was said to be in remission. Those final 2 months the cancer ended up coming back having spread to her bones, She just thought she was sick or experiencing the effects the battle with the disease had on her. Known as bone metastases, cells from the original tumor had spread to her skeletal system and begun developing secondary tumors, breaking down and fracturing her hips/spine. By the time she got to the doctor and figured out what was happening it was just a few weeks until she was gone.

I remember I kept having a cascade of thoughts that were somewhat along the lines of, “oh great look you killed her.” I mean, this was kinda funny seeing that the nature of my brain, like a teasing friend, was to automatically try and guilt trip me into taking responsibility for her death(how could it not that’s prime material.) Obviously its not my fault that a woman who was thought to be in remission had her cancer come back and she passes. Still, the way it all ended seemed so… strange. A few months afterward, while rummaging for something in a cabinet, I stumbled upon an artifact. Around 2 years ago I used to carry around a pirate water bottle with a skull and crossbones on one side, and a sticker that I got at one of her band’s performances on the other. Sitting in my room since middle school, I finally found a way to use it. I viewed it like the duality of life and death, the beauty of art and the wildness of chaos. The violence and horrors of war contrasted with the healing peace found within devotion to something transcendent. Did I accidentally do some sort of voodoo here?  
Fuuuuuucckk.

There is evidence linking certain personality traits to an increased risk of colon cancer aka colorectal cancer (CRC). Studies have shown that traits such as anger and egoism can influence the occurrence of CRC. Emotional regulation issues, particularly anger, and relational styles characterized by egoism have been identified as potential contributors to CRC incidence​.

At the memorial I attended, there was a very common theme amongst individuals sharing their experiences with Susan – that she was a pretty intense person. Many people were initially overwhelmed by, in conflict with, or intimidated by her. Dr. Gabor Mate, a leading expert on trauma and its correlation with illness, describes in his latest book “The Myth of Normal,” that he began to see the linkages between different illnesses and what was being said about individuals in their obituaries, particularly what was being said about their personalities.
