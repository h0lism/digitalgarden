I wasn't planning on having eyes here until I reconnected with, and ran things by, this one guy that I went through my kundalini training with. He was really smart. This was the person that got me to read The Golden Flower, as-well as Jung's Red Book. For a while there he did 1 hour sound baths once a week, and I would stay after and we'd talk for 2+ hours. Started to look at me like I was crazy after I claimed to potentially be Alexander the Great...  but when I put his name into the Gematria...
