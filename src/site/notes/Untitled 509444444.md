Listened to this over 150+ times
nearly everyday
I was meditating to this
on the weeks leading up to different UFO experiences

In research mode,  questioning myself and the topic I was talking about for a second, then saw the 444k in the recommendations n clicked it 
 workflow just shattered
Can't even think anymore
this is personally one of my most profound moments
 I have finally re-connected with [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]] 
This is like 1 trillion dollars (to me)
Although arguably, 
Steve Jobs was an enormous fan of Autobiography of a Yogi,
which is where Babaji was essentially introduced to the western mind.
So much so, he actually had copies of the book handed out to everyone that attended his funeral. 
Apple is worth 4 trillion today.
(but that's misleading because Steve Jobs only owned .25% at the time of his death)
He owned 15% at one point, which would have made him by far, the richest man in the world. Another source claims 11%, and at that rate he would be neck and neck with Elon, only 27 billion behind. Apple alone doesn't account for other sources of his well earned monastery mountain. When Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, Jobs became a member of the company’s board of directors and the company’s largest shareholder, at 7.4%. Yahoo Finance claims that this was about $4.6billion worth.

This website is making a mistake  because it did not increase by 0.47%
Everything is up to par inside though
