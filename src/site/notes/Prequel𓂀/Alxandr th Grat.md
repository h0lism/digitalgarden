Looking into the origins of the Ptolemaic dynasty (after I discovered who Caesarion was), I found that it all started with a man named Ptolemy, one of the most trusted companions and military officers of Alexander the Great. Some rumors have it that Ptolemy was actually an illegitimate son, a bastard of Phillip II, Alexander's father, and so the two were half-brothers. Scholars don't really take this all that seriously and believe the gossip was created by either Ptolemy, or his children in later generations, done in efforts to enhance the legitimacy of their dynasty amongst the Macedonians they were ruling over in Egypt. The heresy suggests that Ptolemy's mother, Arsinoe, was already pregnant with King Phillip’s illegitimate child when she married Lagos, the man originally touted to be his father. While probably not true, I was quite uneducated on the subject at the time, and already feeling like I was in the reception of magical guidance, was very tempted to open my mind to that possibility. Thusly, the idea fueled me into looking further at Alexander the Great - as it felt that perhaps this could potentially be an ancient "relative" whom I knew nothing about, and could potentially hold some sort of quantum/soul/DNA connection to. I was thinking that, potentially, if I was Caesarion, and that were true, and Ptolemy was legitimately related to Alexander, I would theoretically have had ancestry related to Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and Alexander the Great - all in one. This would make the blood flowing through my past body one of the most legendary collections of DNA of all time. The realization of these matters was so crucially important for me because it was something that, in the modern world, would be incredibly helpful to put on my next application to the sperm clinic. Looking back, this whole escapade may have just been a way for myself to cope with the deep intrinsic rejection I felt as a man whom had learned they weren't interested in paying $100 for each deluge I would have been able to whittle out of my (to my knowledge) fertile body. I hadn't discovered food stamps by this point, or perhaps rejected the idea of it, barely getting enough to eat, and after analyzing a sample of my seed, denying my application, I was propelled into seeking redemption. What about my semen wasn't good enough, I am still haunted by the whole ordeal.... 

Looking up Alexander the Great on Audible, I had decided to find a book I could dive into and learn a little bit more. I found one that looked promising. It was 12 hr 34 min. Interesting number pattern, 1 2 3 4.... let's get this going! At first I was ready, but..... then I just sorta let the whole thing go. I didn't want to get sidetracked and start studying this whole other life of a guy that .... I was maybe sorta related to potentially from a conspiracy theory.... all based off of this freshly realized past life thing of Caesarion which I wasn't 100% sure about... yeah maybe we should pass on that. 

I let it go. Shortly afterwards, within a few weeks, I went to the local grocery store and my receipt was exactly $12.34. Part of me was like - holy shit - maybe I was onto something here. The feeling I had wasn't craziness or ego-linking, perhaps Ptolemy really was related to Alexander. Perhaps I may be connected in someway as-well. Maybe I am able to tap into some kingly-warrior inheritance here, calling upon guidance from soul ancestors as I learn about them through this book(something I was in need of). Another part of me thought - maybe this was related to the cute girl that worked at the store, someone I was actively crushing on. The 1 2 3 4 was like the beginning of a relationship, a sign to go for it. I wish I had evidence of this receipt, but alas, it was lost ... I wrote something along the lines of "text (*my phone number*) to start a thumb war" next to the total. The plan was to chat her up and leave the damsel with the receipt, speechless. It would have been smooth as butter .. but, I ended up not seeing her there for a very long time, losing it from my pocket on one of the expeditions there. Now reflecting ... Roxana was Alexander's wife, and this girl was named .... Ana .... Just to show you how neurotic I was(and still am), there was another part of me, a newly developed Gnostic part, which wasn't sure if reality itself was a construct of the enemy or not. Physical reality could be a soul matrix of sorts, and so, these numbers may even be coming in from the creators of this fractured material reality to lead me astray and keep me entrapped chasing phenomenon. In my most fearful state, it seemed the truth of the matter was - you can't even trust the synchronicities anymore... 

After I began to look into Alexander the Great, I saw that he lived to be about 33 years old. He died at 32 in June of 323(keep in mind I was born June 23, as-well as Caesarion), but this was just a month or so before his 33rd birthday. At this point the number 33 was quite an important one in my journey, as outlined in the [[0. Sequence of Events 1].\|0. Sequence of Events 1].]] I was inclined to believe the discovery of 33 Codes could have potentially have had something to do with Alexander the Great who lived to about that age. Even so, I could still attribute it all to Caesarion, whom was the last of the 33rd dynasty of Egypt - and the subject of many theories touting him as the original Jesus whom lived to 33 years.

At this point the path ahead was clear, I knew that I had to give the audiobook a shot. Seems I purchased it on 7-4 as-well. Going through it, the Alexander thing began to grow in its importance within my head. I saw 1234 a couple more times in weird strange situations and it became more and more in my face. One of these was a night where I for some reason decided to take acid again. This was a relapse of sorts, I didn't need to be doing this, terrible idea, and I spent the night quite miserable. As it was coming on I went and checked what time it was, a bit of panic setting in, getting overwhelmed, here we go again... and there was that number sequence again... 

![IMG_8038.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_8038.jpg)

Through the chaos and turbulence, I survived. We made it through by sitting at the top of the staircase for hours. Navigating my phones collection of photography from the past, it seems that, for all my troubles, the Lord Almighty was generous towards me. I was able to acquire this beautiful piece of architecture just two days later from the Facebook Marketplace.

![IMG_8041.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_8041.jpg)

When I look further at my camera roll around this time, it seems that just a bit before this, on June 29th, I had driven past this place in my city that had closed their doors. It was abandoned, but their sign seemed to have a mysterious number on it...

![Pasted image 20251020035239.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251020035239.png)

And just a day later (6-30-23) I had taken this photo of myself

![realeyesrealizereallies.png](/img/user/images/realeyesrealizereallies.png)

I know this looks

I scavenged every photo I could and this was the only vertical pupil I could find, alright,

![secret.png](/img/user/images/secret.png)

One of the things I came across while researching the connection between Ptolemy and Alexander the Great was an interesting theory that Caesarion was not only the real Jesus, but in addition to that, as-well, these guys claimed he was also the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. I'm not stable enough for this to be planted in my mind right now... 💀 At this point I actually had to purchase my first ever Internal Family Systems therapy book. I was either going crazy(hence the Undreaming Wetiko as-well), or quite literally dealing with multiple "parts" or sub-personalities at the highest level. Looking back, it was hilarious. My 'parts' were - not only all the little fragmented versions of Shane that were exiled and forgotten - true and helpful, yes, but at the same time, entering a meta frame, it became a navigation of multiple different past lives simultaneously. As remembrance began and these intense energies would unlock, it became quite difficult to manage the unique karmic loads of each, all quite heavy personalities, all existing in one environment, my mind(pure chaos), simultaneously at once. 

From the terribly schizophrenic website I was referencing (sometimes these guys have gems), 

"This hypothesis builds on the notion that it was Alexander the Great who prepared the entire gentile world to be the future Christendom by bringing it under the rubric of Greek culture, philosophy and influence. Through his conquests, that whole region of the world became a fertile environment for the original Christian evangelists and disciples of Jesus to plant the seeds of the New Testament. So, Jesus (aka Caesarion) in a previous lifetime as Alexander tilled the very lands in which his spiritual message found in the Gospels — both canonical and apocryphal — would eventually take root 2000 plus years ago."
	https://cosmicconvergence.org/?p=287

They went on to mention the fact that at 33 years old both of these individuals died after finishing their life's mission; a similarity which was peculiar of course, but even deeper, a theory that perhaps some of the torture which Jesus underwent was related to the karmic debt endowed upon Alexander. "The Great" had at one point, during a drunken argument, killed one of his greatest generals/friends Cleitus the Black, a man whom at one point had saved his life in battle(but begun criticizing the king). Grabbing a spear from one of the nearby guards, he thrusted it into Cleitus during a spontaneous act of violent fury. Immediately Alexander was regretful of what he had done and set up his spear so that he may fall upon it himself, taking his own life as-well, something which may have occurred that day had others not stepped in and restrained him. Alexander was consumed with the guilt and grief of this for days and spent the aftermath in isolation. He refused food and drink while he sat mourning the loss of a man who had once been one of his most loyal supporters, a tragedy caused by his own hands. They posit that perhaps the Holy Lance, the Spear of Longinus, aka the Spear of Destiny or the Holy Spear, was an example of the karmic debt to be paid for by the man whose search for glory and military conquests were a momentous tribulation for those whom he conquered, as-well as his own men. 

![Fra_Angelico_027.jpg](/img/user/images/Fra_Angelico_027.jpg)

I mean.... you can see how the stage was set, how the possibility was there, this idea - as it began to unfold in my head... finding different trails of evidence. I'm still not sure about the Jesus story, what it is that actually unfolded, and that this example of karmic continuance has any merit. It would also make sense for my ego, having already discovered Caesarion, to try and distract me on this path of nonsense - to get past-life happy - so that things don't settle properly. Is one not good enough? Once the novelty and specialness of being the son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra wears off, ughh, I need something new to give me life and a sense of "great" importance. Even after achieving a level of ego death where one could access this sort of information, now I have to go through the entire cyclical process again - integrating and adjusting to this new understanding. Imagine the forces of darkness witnessing my discoveries. It would be so profoundly - not good - for their side of the team if someone were able to do all of this and relay it to their fellow man. It felt like going deep enough to uncover Caesarion opened me up to a whole 'nother dimension, one in which there may legitimately be a highly intelligent malevolent force that is trying to kill me and my efforts(perhaps just my own self-destructive shadow). This force, if I am not careful, may have the capacity to influence me in what appears to be a transcendent manner, psychically leading me from delusion to delusion until I am so distracted and off course, filled with utter nonsense, that nobody would ever listen to me. At that point we can just let this profound moment disappear silently with no witnesses, maybe even get him in a psych-ward or something after he loses the respect of all his friends, colleagues, and family. This was the internal battle I was facing - does the rabbit hole go deeper than I originally conceived, are we just brimming the surface of things? Or could it be that my ungrounded grandiosity is acting like a shovel that is making the situation deeper than it is, with the hands guiding it into the dirt potentially being led by some sort of psychic enemy seeking to derail me, or even more malevolently, my own subconscious. Is there actually treasure at the bottom of the pit? Is evil tempting me into this rabbit hole, or is it tempting me away from it. Is any of this even real at all. Have I done too many drugs? I can't tell, I don't know what's going on anymore - and there is nobody I can look to as an example of having gone through something like this.
Good luck buddy! Godspeed ahead.

While I was going through the kundalini training, I had gotten myself deep in the trenches of reptilian conspiracies. David Icke was someone I had found a few years beforehand and as I kept having phenomenal experiences, a lot of what he was saying all began to make some sense. His model of the world actually had some elements of genius in it. Even if I didn't believe 100% of everything he discussed, some of it a little overly fearful, there were many gems. I went through his entire book "The Trap" while my kundalini was being trained. Reptilian snake beings, from my perspective, seemed to have a deep historical footing within the Hindu religion. The Naga serpent race, due to the [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]] situation which was unfolding for me, was very in my face, and it felt like it was my duty to get to the bottom of things - myself perhaps under celestial guidance. What was first a joke, ooooh shapeshifting reptiles running the world - "I saw Michelle Obama blink her eyes vertically and sneak a mouse from her purse at the white house dinner" - quickly became a very real philosophical inquiry. It seemed so ridiculous and absurd, but actually true in some way. I knew that the most accurate frame of reality would have to stem from a core understanding of how this element contributes to our experience. There was something there. The Gnostic Christians, folks I learned about shortly after going through David's book, with their idea of the Archons, to me, it seemed that this was the same as the reptilians Mr. Icke was speaking of. The reptilians were likely not some sort of ancient dinosaurs that figured out how to own banks, make hit pop music and run the government. It seemed to me, that instead, they may be some sort of higher dimensional force which influences humanity. They ran the world, creating a matrix of sorts, THROUGH the people whom ran the world, corrupted spirits perhaps somehow in touch with these beings. I could tell that there was some sort of parasitic evil, and that [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/Wetiko (Weeds)\|Wetiko (Weeds)]] is essentially the result of this influence. The entire beginning of this journey was all about this book on Wetiko. I had somehow navigated my way to it shortly after releasing, and I felt as though it were the most important topic that humanity could ever begin to digest. Autistic intensity meets destiny calling, every chapter was like a different download each day. I had been summoned to study. David Icke's book was quite a treat, he had come to the realization of the archon link AND specifically talked about Wetiko as-well, it felt like a group huddle. If this higher dimensional spirit warfare was going down behind the scenes, if it were to be something actually occurring, it would be one of the most important realizations we could integrate as a species. Who knows, maybe there are some sort of lizard people that live in caves underground out there as-well, running things, maybe they are cool and scared of us, I have no idea, but the higher dimensional oppression thing makes sense to me given the condition of our planet. 

Beginning the Alexander biography, I was exposed to a myth surrounding his birth which I had never heard before. His mother, Olympias, was supposedly part of the orgiastic cult of Dionysus - perhaps even considered a priestess amongst them. Plutarch describes her as "wont to have great tame serpents about her, which sometimes creeping out of the ivy in the mystic fans, sometimes winding themselves about the sacred spears, and the women's chaplets, made a spectacle which men could not look upon without terror." Philip II must have been into it as-well, or at-least heeded some of her suggestions, as it seems he added Dionysian symbols to his coins, and Dionysus figures appeared in palace mosaics. To the wider Greek world, Dionysus was the God of grapes and their harvest, wine making and drinking, festivals, joy and pleasure, theater, fertility, and divine frenzy.

![Pasted image 20251020043011.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251020043011.png)

To initiates of his wilder mystery cults, like those Olympias likely belonged to, he embodied something more primal: a chthonic(underworld) force of death and rebirth, boundary-dissolution, and communion with the divine through trance and ritual possession. Part of their religious practice, considered somewhat wild and foreign by the more sober Macedonians, involved ecstatic dancing, trance, spontaneous animal sacrifices, the use of sacred objects, and, most notably, the handling of snakes. Serpents were seen as symbols of the god and embodiments of divine power. In some representations, Dionysus would be depicted with snakes wound around his thyrsus (staff), or even as a shapeshifter that would transform into a serpent. In Orphic myths - diverging a bit from the Homeric stories - he is born as Zagreus, child of Zeus and Persephone. This tradition includes Egyptian elements, having several motifs in parallel with the Osiris myth. Zeus, it is said, seduced her in the form of a serpent(drakōn). Zagreus, a child crowned heir to the cosmos(even placed upon the throne of heaven), was then torn apart by the jealous Titans(after being lured with toys). The titans then, in some versions, consume him - all but his heart. The Neoplatonist Damascius offers a preserved glimpse at how this myth concludes in the Orphic tradition...

“Zeus, recovering the heart, swallowed it; and then gave birth to him again, this time through Semele.”  
— _On the Principles (De Principiis)_, Fragment 123 (Orphic fragments)

This version of the tale differs sharply from the more familiar Hellenistic or classical Greek account. In the latter, Dionysus is not originally the divine child Zagreus, but instead, the son of Zeus and Semele, a mortal princess of Thebes. After beguiling Semele with heavenly charm (appearing as a handsome and radiant man), Zeus promises to grant her anything she desires. Spurred on by Hera’s jealousy(Zeus's bm), Semele demands to see her lover in his full divine glory... 
Unable to revoke the oath he made, Zeus reveals himself, and “visited her in a way befitting a god, accompanied by thundering and lightning… Semele… unable to endure the majesty of the divine presence… was herself slain by the fire.” It turns out that she was pregnant, and from her dying body, Zeus rescues their unborn child—effectively performing the world’s first ever mythical “Caesarian section”<-- [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]. To protect the premature infant, Zeus sews Dionysus into his own thigh, carrying him to term until he is finally born a second time, now fully divine and immortal - the last of the 12 Olympians. 

"And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords."
	Revelation 19:16

The name Dionysus likely means _“Zeus of Nysa”_ or _“Son of Zeus from Nysa.”_ The first element, Dio-, comes from the genitive form of Zeus (_Dios_), while -nysos refers to the mythic region of Nysa, where the god was said to have been raised in secret(by nymphs and a satyr). Dionysus also appears in Mycenaean Greek as Di-wo-nu-so, seen in Bronze Age tablets from Pylos and Knossos. This is highly significant because it places Dionysus in the 13th–12th century BCE, long before the fully developed classical pantheon, and challenges the once-common Greek belief that he was a later, foreign import from the East. Instead, his presence among other major deities in these early records, shows that Dionysus was already an integral part of the Greek religious world. The form _Di-wo-_ comes from _Diwos_, an early form of Zeus, confirming that the association between Dionysus and Zeus — as divine son — may be primitive and not invented later.

Dimētōr, meaning “twice-born,” is an ancient nickname for Dionysus which originates from agricultural symbolism and mystery cult theology. As Diodorus Siculus(BC era Greek historian) explains, Dionysus is first “born” when the vine takes root, and again when it bears fruit — a metaphor for both vegetative cycles and divine rebirth. It can also represent the maturation of the person having grown from childhood seedling - to a second birth in adulthood, so to say - the fruit bore is the maturation of spiritual wisdom and consciousness(DiMēTōr @JoeRogan). This alternative title for Dionysus is often attributed to the more famous Hellenistic myth, the "two mothers" being the mortal Semele, who conceived him, and Zeus himself, who acted as a second womb via his thigh. Of course, the title also fits with the Orphic tradition where Dionysus was born first to Persephone (as Zagreus), and then reborn through Semele... and if you include the Zeus thigh situation, now we are at three. In Orphic hymns to _Dionysus_ he is referred to as thrice begotten or Triogonos (the _thrice born_), seen as a “dying and coming back god” resurrection archetype with close associations to the harvest cycle. 

“I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener."
	John 15:1-2

One of the most fascinating legends surrounding Alexander’s birth centers on his mother, Olympias. Ancient biographers like Plutarch recount how she was said to have consorted with serpents during the nocturnal rites of Dionysus, often keeping tame snakes in her bedchamber. These stories fed into rumors that Philip II was not Alexander’s true father. According to the tale, Olympias claimed that Zeus himself, in the form of a serpent, had visited her and impregnated her with divine seed. Philip, it is said, once caught sight of a great snake lying beside his wife as she slept, and from that point forward, suspicion haunted their marriage. Whether mere gossip, political propaganda, or a genuine reflection of some sort of strange reptilian phenomenon, the myth established Alexander to view himself as the living son of Zeus, destined for greatness. It seems to me that this could have been one of the factors contributing to Alexander's incredible conquest abilities. Either that, or the entirety of the situation was an example of the profound influence and power belief has over us, a placebo of Great proportions. Philip reportedly dreamed that he sealed his wife's womb with a seal bearing the image of a lion, which diviners interpreted as prophecy of a courageous son. Jesus, you know, "Lion of Judah."

Revelation 5:5
	And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”

Revelation 13:2
	And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.



I actually completely let this Alexander thing go. I thought it was too crazy. We can just rock with the Caesarion thing and we will be good. Then out came Sabbatai Zevi, Seneca, Lodovicco Lazarelli, and then Aleister Crowley. Maybe we should look back

Looking into the Gematria of things, it seems that my kundalini instructor, with her full name (including middle initial), followed by Olympias = 1234. Kundalini, the serpent energy, Olympias the snake worshipper. Touted as one of the most evil women of history, at-least I'm not the only one here with a heavy shadow.... :P

![Pasted image 20250828172357.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250828172357.png)



Here are some of the things which had caught my attention in the book.
(Over time I will add what comes to me)

Many are unaware that Alexander had a child with his wife Roxana, Alexander IV, who was born shortly after his sudden death in Babylon. The precise date of birth for Alexander IV is unknown, but it had to be in late 323 or early 322 BCE. Roxana was 6-8 months pregnant at the time of his fathers death. This child never made it to the throne, having been swept away in the fallout of Macedonian mania as everyone fought to wield the power of the empire for themselves. Being a Conqueror doesn’t generally come with a retirement plan, and your kid is sort of screwed when, on your death bed, and asked “Who shall have the empire?”, you reply, “To the Strongest!”. All of this felt peculiarly similar to the situation with Ptolemy Caesar. Like Alexander, Caesar died without a stable succession plan, leaving behind a young heir whose claim to power was swiftly overshadowed by the ambitions of others. Albeit, Octavian was named the legitimate heir to Rome, Caesarion, like Alexander IV, was caught in the crossfire of political upheaval, ultimately executed by Octavian as he consolidated power. Each son was killed by the fear of a biological boy's potential for future claims to inheritance. In both cases, the death of a legendary leader triggered a ruthless scramble for control, and their sons, were eliminated to clear the path for new regimes.

The Gordian Knot was a legendary, complex knot tied to an oxcart in Gordium, Phrygia, by King Gordias. It was connected to a prophecy that whoever could untie it would rule Asia(oh my Gord). In 333 BCE, Alexander the Great, instead of trying to untie it, just cuts right through it with his sword. Well that's one story. The one recorded by his own scribe actually claimed that he found the perfect point to weaken the knot and untied it after some calculation. The first tale sounds a bit more "Alexander" if you ask me, and the fact that the record keeper would produce a different story that aggrandizes the king seems to fit even more hilariously. The story has become a metaphor for _brute force_.

- [ ] During the Mallian siege, Alexander the Great was struck in the left breast by an arrow, which pierced his thorax and lung, causing a life-threatening tension pneumothorax, leading to dizziness, swooning, and a period of unconsciousness.
	- [ ] Right as I had listened to this portion of the audiobook, I'm not sure if it was before or after, but in a 24 hour period I injured my chest in the Gym and pulled a pec, which now has a little aesthetic alteration as evidence of this. Going too hard, striving for glory, to push my strength to new heights, I believe that this was done this while listening to the song Alexander the Great by Iron Maiden as-well. 

At one point the book talks about how Alexander had been initiated as a "pharaoh" of Egypt. A few days later I found myself going to the yoga studio, on the way to one of Aristotle's ([[Prequel𓂀/EVERYTHING'S A ROUGH DRAFT\|EVERYTHING'S A ROUGH DRAFT]]) soundbaths. 
Recently we had been discussing how the eye of Horus had a similar structure to the pineal gland. To demonstrate...

![horus.jpg|400](/img/user/images/horus.jpg)

After conquering Egypt, Alexander journeyed deep into the desert to visit the famous Oracle of Amun at the Siwa Oasis. The priests there famously welcomed him as the "son of Amun." For Alexander and his followers, this was a big deal. Since Amun was equated with Zeus, the oracle was essentially confirming that Alexander was the son of Zeus. This solidified his divine status, legitimized his rule over Egypt as a god-king (pharaoh), and served as powerful propaganda throughout his empire. Coins were minted that depicted Alexander with the "horns of Amun" curling around his ears. I started to look some of this up, and discovered an image that related this to the hippocampal structure of the brain. 

![IMG_8046.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_8046.jpg)

I was excited to bring this insight to philosopher Aristotle. It was kind of tripping me out. When I arrived at the studio, where the (sound) bowls were about to be lit up, I was thrown into an even more "tripped out" state when I parked behind a truck that had this sticker on it. I had to pull this from google, my phone was either dead or I didn't bring it with me. I specifically remember this feeling even more maddening because I wouldn't have evidence. 

![Dodge-Ram-Head-Muscle-Truck-Decal-Sticker.jpg](/img/user/images/Dodge-Ram-Head-Muscle-Truck-Decal-Sticker.jpg)

Alexander was really into The Illiad and The Odyssey. It was basically his bible.

![Pasted image 20251020061019.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251020061019.png)

Late one night listening to this at 4am under the influence of marijuana, probably a month or two after the purchase, I had a visionary experience of...

"For as they’d assembled, eager to cross the trench,                                             
a bird had gone above them, a high-flying eagle,
moving past the left flank of the troops, gripping                                   
in its talons a huge blood-red snake, still alive,
still struggling. It hadn’t lost its will to fight.
Doubling up, it struck the bird that clutched it
beside the neck. The eagle, stung with pain,
let the snake fall down onto the ground, dropping it
right in the middle of the crowd. Then with a cry,
it flew off downwind. Seeing that writhing snake,
lying there in their midst, Trojans shuddered. It was a sign,
a powerful omen, from aegis-bearing Zeus."

The next day I went with my family out to dinner somewhere. My cousin was in town and we went out to a place that was a bit of a drive. On the way there, navigating through some of the scenic terrain of Idaho, I had a strange continuation of this audio passage. As we were crossing a bridge, I looked to the right, and there it was, an eagle flying alongside with us, and in it's talons, was a snake. This took place around 12 hours after listening to that. Then, that summer, when I began to garden, there was another strange occurrence. I had acquired a second gardening job a few months after the first, taking care of a property belonging to an retired professor of hydrology and a wetland conservation scientist. A few months in, I had randomly discovered a dead snake in their lawn. They were actually coming home as this happened, and drove in on me holding it -  a bit grossed out. Examining the body, it seemed to have some sort of marks, like it was bitten or something. On my way out, driving home, just outside their property, I saw a giant hawk/eagle(they were somewhat out in the country there were eagles) sitting on a telephone line. Just sitting there. Ahh okay, so those were talon marks. Perhaps. 

Bucephalus (RIP June 326 BC)

Shortly before this all began to go down, my father and I had just acquired a new canine friend. It had been a while since our last dog died, something which was quite hard on us both, but we were finally ready. His name was Kato, originally Kilo from a prior owner. Cato the Younger was Caesar's enemy and committed suicide in protest of his rise to power. One night, I went out to the bars with a few friends and met a girl that was looking to find a new home for her puppy. She was a friend of one of my friends and throughout the evening, was selling me on the little bugger. There were some serious marketing skills in that woman, and by the end of the night, my hopes were up. Life was about to be good again, I've been miserable longing for a little furry friend. This is going to be awesome. I start getting all excited - but as soon as I fall for the idea, she hesitatingly informs me that her father would be looking for a rehoming fee, something around $500 or so. Immediately the dream comes crashing down and I know this thing ain't happening. You can tell she sorta felt about about having withheld that part, almost like she was too anxious to say anything about it before. Life goes on, and within a few months, she randomly sends me a text. It was a link to a reddit post, just a few hours after it was posted, from someone that was local to us and looking to rehome their dog. Justice was on the horizon. I showed a picture of the dog to my father, whom remarked she was "a cutie," and got the green light to enter pursuit. I sent a message to the guy on Reddit, brother to the owner, and was able to convince him we would be the best fit. My father has been a rock and roll guitar player his entire life, so when I got the brothers name and number - we both knew that something special was going on here. A musician as-well, the guys name was Mercury Hendrix. What a title. Freddie Mercury was actually an enormous fan of Jimmie Hendrix, his largest inspiration, whom he kept a photo of on his bedroom mirror for inspiration. Freddie even drew this portrait of him

It turns out that Mercury was looking to rehome the cutest little 1-1½ year old beauty, a wild little girl named Olive. There's no consensus on her breed, but she looks like a Rhodesian Ridgeback mix of some sort. Olive had way too much energy for someone that was constantly working and out of the house playing gigs, and was not doing well being left alone. He really loved her, but given that his situation had recently changed, didn't feel that he could provide her the attention she desperately needed. He felt that it was wrong and wanted to find her a home with someone that could spend all day with her, my retired father a prominent candidate. I went over to pick her up and could instantly see what he was talking about. This little lady was ball of unlimited energy. He was a very genuine person and didn't even want to charge us anything, but for her to just be happy. For a young man whom believes he may be some sort of Jesus figure, to have the fates place upon him a new canine named Olive, was quite mindboggling. Am I in a weird simulatory dream? Now she is a puppy at this point, and perhaps a stubborn breed, but my father and I about went insane at times dealing with her. This was just about 7 months before I began to go through the Alexander the Great book . 

We began to notice that Olive was a maniac. At first she was just your average puppy, you know, the energy you have at a year and a half or so. My Dad used to breed Shar-Peis, and overtime, began to see that her personality was unlike any other girls he has had before. We began to refer to her as "the beast." Taking her on a walk was like bringing a bullet train out onto the sidewalk. I would constantly have to yank on the leash to heel her as she began to walk me -unable to keep up(which didn't stop her). Olive was a vicious little thing, violently barking at nearly any noise - the lid of a garbage can from across the street closing, for example. It would take 5+ minutes to calm her down, every time(15+ times a day). Around 3 months after getting her, doing LSD in my fathers basement, a floating white orb visited us. I was too high to move my body, having my entire paradigm of reality completely shattering in real time - but Olive who was with me, she began to bark at this thing. She looked at me, looked at the orb, was barking, then looked back at me, and slowly became terrified. Olive realized that this thing was on another level, she could detect that her barks were not going to have any power over this thing in the basement, and you could see her beginning to cower down and become just as terrified as me. It was actually nice to have someone there with me going through this experience, if she wasn't helping to validate the existence of this thing I don't know I would have retained sanity.

There was a book released in 1947 titled, "_Son of the Black Stallion_" by Walter Farley. It was the third book in a series on 

Ultimately the story mirrors the ancient legend of a young Alexander the Great taming his "untamable" black stallion, Bucephalus, when no one else could. In the film, this is made explicit when Alec's father gives him a figurine of Bucephalus just before the shipwreck.**


	"When Alec receives the Black Stallion’s first son as a gift, he believes his dreams have come true, but Satan’s savage arrogance makes him dangerous and unpredictable. Still, Alec is resolved to gain the fiery colt’s trust, even if he must risk his life to do it."

Lots to get into here about theories of Dionysus being the original Jesus

Julius Caesar crying about not achieving anything at 37 when he reads about Alexander's achievements. 

Dionysus myth turning wine into water

Dionysus riding donkey, Jesus riding donkey, Lodovicco Lazarelli 'mentor'  riding donkey

Turn him to any cause of policy,  
The Gordian Knot of it he will unloose,  
Familiar as his garter

# “Each moment free from fear makes a man immortal.”  
― Alexander the Great

Just 3 months after I purchased the Alexander the Great book and went through it, my favorite artist at the time, Izaya Tiji, drops an album titled "Alexandria." Izaya is known for identifying as schizophrenic, and so when I started to go through my own phase, he was one of the only people I listened to. It just felt like this guy was on the same wavelength.

The day I first uploaded this page was on 10-20-2025 and then later I went to the store (Two Cents). Last time I was there was 6 days ago... and then one of the recent times before that 9-29-25...

Also, when I came back, ready to eat some food, I found this video from someone whom I don't believe I had watched prior pop up front and center.

Looking at related gematria, I mistook Santorini for having a 555 with the 714 and 119 and then began to look it up "Santorini alexa" to see if there was anything related to Alexander, at which point, Google began to recommend "Alexandria" to finish the prompt

Turns out that it is the name of a Greek Restaurant in Alexandria, with 323(the year Great dies) reviews and 4.7 overall rating(pretty common though). This is just an example of the kinds of weird very subtle synchronicities which turn up in this space, initial mistakes oftentimes turn into some sort of weird path to something
