Have you every had a dream where you somehow found yourself at school with no pants on?

I wasn't planning on having eyes here until I reconnected with, and ran things by, this one guy that I went through my kundalini training with. He was really smart. This was the person that got me to read The Golden Flower, as-well as Jung's Red Book. For a while there he did 1 hour sound baths once a week. I would stay after and we'd talk for 2+ hours straight, probably close to 4 hours a few times. He knew someone that was a descendant of the Forbes family and one of the scholars who helped translate the Nag Hammadi Codex (it may have been the Dead Sea Scrolls)... with their own island. This person was severely mentally ill, having dissociative identity disorder, what he believed to be the result of ritualistic abuse. They even let their genitals burn out in the sun... Started to look at me like I was crazy after I claimed to potentially be Alexander the Great...  but when I put his name into the Gematria...

I was really into [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] at the time, and after a yoga class, I had this weird feeling that I was supposed to somehow organize another channeling situation, that Ra was trying to contact me. Feeling this was a bit crazy, my ego beginning to run a bit wild, I went back to go say goodbye to my friend and check in real quick with another human being before I went home, and walked in on this...
