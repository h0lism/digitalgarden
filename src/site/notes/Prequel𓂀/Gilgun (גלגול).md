**"Shaar HaGilgulim"** (The Gate of Reincarnations)

> A king had a vineyard which he had planted. When he saw that the wine was not good, he uprooted it and planted it again. He did this several times. They asked him, "How long will you continue to do this?" He replied, "Until it produces good wine."
	**Sefer HaBahir** (Book of Brilliance)

Turns out there was some guy named Rabbi [[Prequel𓂀/Shani\|Shani]] that talked about reincarnation. I don't think this guy is really all that special, he seems like your average ideological Rabbi, but found his name and this particular subject matter interesting.

"This significant phenomenon of reincarnation can be invoked to resolve numerous questions and apparent contradictions concerning issues of faith, reward and punishment, suffering of the righteous, and contentment of the wicked."

What I found interesting is that, this strange Rabbi Shani, in one of the only works of his I was able to find, seems to mention a [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]]. I'm not sure that he is referencing the same one that I have interest in, but I found it funny. There was some evil guru in America teaching wicked philosophy, so he told this woman to go back and recite the Psalms in the crowd while he was teaching. The first time he began to get upset and kicked her out. The second time, he dropped dead. Putting a bad wrap on Babaji and the name Shani, I can't believe this slander...

The seal, 
once popped, 
began to flow.
I was no longer a single person, 
but a chorus.
