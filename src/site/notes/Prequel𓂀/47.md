# DopenessOnDeck47

It all began with a dream.
DopenessOnDeck47
It came to me
Out of the woodworks
an alternate persona
at work washing dishes
serving sandwiches
I discovered my purpose
I was going to create a YouTube channel

The idea was to cross breed the consciousness of JollieOllie420 with someone like Tony Robbins and the kid that bends spoons in the matrix. Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High with Steven Hawking, Guy Fieri and Eckhart Tolle. At first you would think - this man has been to too many raves, he sounds absolutely ridiculous - but eventually, somehow, someway, it would become evident that he has broken through to an absolutely profound understanding of reality. Sounds so dumb, his brain is absolutely fried off its gord, but the content of what he is speaking about is opening my mind up to think in ways which it has not before. He embodies a consciousness which I have never seen before. It's like a self directed Mk Ultra project. It's as though in the process of frying his brain, another part of it had evolved and transformed - what could perhaps be the evolution of man. This brave young veteran has gone to learn from the depths of God face to face and is a living wizard whom verbalizes speech in the form of dimethyltryptamine hits to the pineal with each consonant embodying reality shattering wisdom. 

This is what DopenessOnDeck47 was going to be. Ultimately an individual attempting to share advanced spiritual concepts under a hidden identity of stoner cheech and chong man. Maybe he somehow is able to figure out how to save the world and evolve mankind. Maybe he's just able to make enough money to make it out of his Dad's basement. 

"Yo whats going on guys dopenessondeck here, 47,  whats up
today I wanted to talk to you guys about astrological time travel exploration through fifth dimensional time hopping strategies 
We're going to tap into some breathwork and then rock ourselves into the astral realm of infinite forgiveness, overseen by the Andromedan star emissaries of the light, let your auric field become filled with turquoise and neon green zebra print light - just download some celestial energies here today before we move forward and align chakras 9-12, activating our merkaba light vehicle 
maybe release our sins and cleanse ourselves of all karma liberating ourselves
from the punishments accumulated over all lifetimes forever 
before we come back down
we're going to visit the palace of unlimited swagger 
just chill for a moment, catch our breath - holding it for 5 seconds to begin to enter the parasympathetic nervous system - we let in the feeling of safety, of chillness 
Now with this heightened vibrational frequency we're going to navigate our consciousness
to go ahead and release a prayer for the liberation of all beings
may all find that feeling of legitness deep inside themselves
housed within the nebula galaxy deep inside of star cluster Barbados992x4
this is a realm of incredibly potent divine energy..."

Soon I began to see the number everywhere. 
I had just pulled it out completely randomly.
And then it painted my world. 

I became obsessed.
Started looking into it.
Saw that other people were obsessed as-well.
Alright this is weird.

I had all sorts of strange things begin to occur.
I thought I saw a UFO.

Eventually I got myself into a kundalini yoga teacher training. 
After it was over, I found a deeper layer to the number than I 
could have ever guessed possible. 

Here is a summary of all that I could find.

# Capital Steeze

![Screenshot 2025-02-28 034819.png](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-02-28%20034819.png)

In middle school I was a huge fan of rap music. Joey Badass was one of my favorites. I also played a lot of Call of Duty, and the people that were making montages - for their aesthetically complex trick-shots and phenomenally impressive quad feeds - often synced their edits to music from the label he was in, Pro Era. I liked most of the artists I came across, but Joey Badass and Capital Steeze had to be 2 of my favorites from that scene(along with The Underachievers). 1999(ft. Steeze), Joeys debut mixtape, specifically, was something that I was bumping nonstop as a young suburban 13 year old. 

Little did I know anything of Capital Steeze's obsession with the number 47, or the fact that I was soon to follow in his footsteps down a rabbit hole I may never find my way out of. Unfortunately it seems he never did, tragically committing suicide at the age of 19, jumping off his record labels building in New York, on the date 12/23/12 - which adds up perfectly to 47. 

Steeze's connection to 47 extended beyond simple interest, it was a core component of his spiritual belief system and promulgated who he was as an artist. He viewed this number as the "perfect expression of balance in the world," representing the tension between the heart and mind, emotion and intellect, thought and feeling - the 4th and 7th chakras. The 4th chakra, Anahata, representing the heart, and the 7th chakra, Sahisrara, representing the crown. 47 was the number that represented the perfect balance between the two. 

Steeze viewed himself as an indigo(put onto the idea by Issa of The Underachievers), a being of higher dimensional consciousness and this played into his image and the music that he created. It gave a foundation for his obsession with the number to flourish. His perception of himself as a multidimensional being hints to us that he could have perhaps viewed the number as a key to understanding the nature of reality itself, being a guiding force for the unfoldment of his spiritual journey. 

The most visible manifestation of the number 47 in Steez's work appeared on the cover of his mixtape "AmeriKKKan Korruption."

![47-19-8-23-18-5-58m.jpg](/img/user/images/47-19-8-23-18-5-58m.jpg) 
The number was prominently displayed on the album artwork, stylized in a way that resembled a swastika.

Unfortunately, the scene he was in was not built for someone of that nature. He went too deep into the spiritual side of things. Describing his memories in an interview with a therapist, Joey Badass 

"Eventually it got to a point where he would speak 
and nobody would understand
that's kind of how you knew.. like..
he was advancing, you know what I'm saying
...
I think that he thought that he was
dreaming 
...
closer to his death, you know,
there was just days where I would just 
look him in his eyes and he's looking past me
he's not looking at anything that's here
he's not looking at me
he's looking through me, like way past"

The therapist then remarked that it sounded as though Steeze had opened himself up to all of this spiritual awareness - but didn't himself have a teacher that could help him to assimilate and unpack what he was experiencing. He couldn't process it all, and being too much, he didn't know what to do - was overwhelmed - ultimately leading to his suicide. 

Joey agreed wholeheartedly.

I'm not certain that my exploration into this number would have found the propellant fuel it needed if I wasn't witness to Steeze's journey of plunging into the numbers wilderness and carving the way before me. This inspired a belief in me that I wasn't just going crazy, maybe there was something to it - so I didn't dismiss it. 
I stuck to it long enough to find what it was about.

4ever res7 in peace.

# Checker 47

![Kukuk-gold.jpg](/img/user/images/Kukuk-gold.jpg)

Checker 47 is a handsome grey Westphalian gelding, born back in 2010. 
Ridden by his equestrian Christian Kukuk, the duo has lately been taking the world by storm. 

Since its inception in 1974, the Winter Equestrian Festival has been one of the world's most prestigious horse events, spanning over 13 weeks. In March of 2024, Christian and Checker 47 were able to secure victory, winning the finale of the $500,000 Rolex CSI5* Grand Prix. 
Later in the year, the team took on the Olympics in Paris.
Christian and Checker 47, with a nearly perfect performance, took home the Individual Jumping Gold, and ended a 28-year drought plaguing their country in the event.
For their "horse" country Germany, housing more horses than any other country in Europe, and having a reputation for their production of top-quality horses and riders, this was a big win. 
Just recently, in January of 2025, they also won the $215,000 NetJets CSI4 Grand Prix.*
Checker 47 is the highest earning horse over the last 2 years, having amassed an eye-watering total of nearly $3 million in career prize money, a majority of that coming in from their recent and legendary tournament tear.

"Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse...
.... He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood"

# Whale

![HHT4COIYDBHJHCNFNFISEL3O34.kpg.jpg](/img/user/images/HHT4COIYDBHJHCNFNFISEL3O34.kpg.jpg)

Less than 6 months ago, a dead fin whale, measuring approximately 47 feet long, washed ashore on the tidal flats near Anchorage, Alaska. Fin whales themselves are seen quite rarely, this event drawing hundreds of visitors and becoming a citywide phenomenon. They still do not know what caused its death, but if all goes as planned, the skeleton will have a permanent home at a Wasilla museum.

I could have sworn I had already seen this article at some point, thinking that the 47 foot thing wasn't much of a big deal, there are a lot of whales out there of all sorts of lengths, but realizing that I was mistaking this incidence for another made me think it would be worth including. 

![fwc-sperm-whale-florida-keys.jpg](/img/user/images/fwc-sperm-whale-florida-keys.jpg)

In the shallows of Key West Florida, in May of 2022, was found a once majestic 47-foot sperm whale, who swam through the waters with grace, being feasted upon by a whole host of sharks, dead. 
	the whale “had a mass of intertwined line, net pieces and a plastic bag-type material in its stomach. This debris likely did not allow the whale to eat properly, leading to its emaciated condition and stranding.”

"He turned their waters into blood,  
    causing their fish to die."
	Psalm 105:29

"a third of the living creatures in the sea died, 
and a third of the ships were destroyed."
	Revelation 8:9
# Pomona College

![pomona-college-47.jpg](/img/user/images/pomona-college-47.jpg)

Pomona College, a prestigious liberal arts institution in Claremont, California, is home to a unique tradition centered around the number 47. Located off Interstate 10's exit 47, the college became the birthplace of what would later be known as "The 47 Society." This tradition began in 1964 when students Laurie Mets and Bruce Elgin conducted a research project exploring whether the number 47 appeared more frequently in nature than expected by chance. Soon students began to see 47 often. They termed it the quintessential random number. Their findings, coupled with a humorous mathematical proof created going back and forth with professor Donald Bentley, claiming that 47 was equal to Pi, even later being argued to equal all numbers, became a meme among students, and a tradition in his class from that point on, along with proceeding professors in later decades. Over time, the number became ingrained in Pomona's culture, with numerous "47 sightings" documented across campus. One of such is in Mudd-Blaisdell (formally Florence Carrier Blaisdell and Della Mullock Mudd Hall, a title with 47 characters), which contains the largest dormitory's staircase at 47 balusters, finishing in its construction in 1947. Another is that there are 47 pipes around the top row of Lyman Hall Organ in the Thatcher Music Building. The Smith Memorial Tower, in the early 2010's, was set to chime on the 47th minute of the hour. The tradition has even extended beyond campus, leaking into the world through alumni contributions. 

The most famous of these is from Joe Menosky incorporating references to 47 in _Star Trek_ episodes. Today, Pomona celebrates this quirky tradition annually on April 7 (4/7)
# Star-Trek

Writer and producer Joe Menosky, an alumni of Pomona College, brought the 47 tradition with him when he joined the writing staff of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). Menosky started embedding the number 47 into scripts and other screen details. Writers and production staff members caught on and embraced the easter egg, ensuring its continued appearance even in episodes Menosky wasn't directly involved with.

It has appeared in numerous ways across TNG, _Deep Space Nine_, _Voyager_, _Enterprise_, and even newer series like Discovery and Picard. You might spot it:

- On computer console displays (LCARS readouts)
- As part of stardates
- In quantities mentioned in dialogue ("There are 47 survivors," "Frequency 47," "Section 47")
- On star charts or technical schematics
- As part of ship registry numbers or designations (though less common)
- Even subtly hidden in set design elements.

It became a fun tradition for fans to spot the "47" in episodes, and perhaps drove a few others mad wondering as to what its significance may be.

# Dodgers

![GZaoVaBasAQt--7.jpeg](/img/user/images/GZaoVaBasAQt--7.jpeg)

On October 8th 2024, the Los Angeles Dodgers played in a quarter finals match against the San Diego Padres in their home stadium. The sell out crowd filling the Padres Petco Park stadium broke a new record for attendees, touching 47,774 people in total.

The Dodgers then went on to win the World Series in its entirety.
The MLB playoff payout, luckily for them, had hit a record $129 million.
This left them each with $477,740.70
Not much for someone like Shohei Ohtani, the highest paid MLB player,
whom they have on a 10 year contract for $700,000,000 -
but it may be a handsome payday for players getting paid
the MLB's minimum salary, which during 2024, was $740,000.


![JACKIE_ROBINSON_DEBUT_PNG_ec993a0db8.png](/img/user/images/JACKIE_ROBINSON_DEBUT_PNG_ec993a0db8.png)

Jackie Robinson was the first to cross the Major League Baseball's color barrier on April 15, 1947. This made him the first African American to play professionally when he took the field playing first base for the _Dodgers_ (although notably they were located in Brooklyn at the time). A ticket to that game, in 2022, sold for a whopping $480,000

![41YCQo56mgL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg](/img/user/images/41YCQo56mgL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)

Jackie Robinson's number was 42. According to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, 42 is "the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything." For a number heralded as so important, it really is quite close to 47.  

When Star Trek producer and screenwriter Rick Berman had been asked by curious fans about the significance of the number 47 appearing all over the place within the franchise. He once joked, "47 is 42, corrected for inflation," in reference.

On June 5th 1947 Secretary of State George Marshall proposed the Marshall plan in a speech delivered to 15,000 people at Harvard University, a US initiative to help rebuild war-torn Western Europe after WW2. Providing financial relief to help rebuild the economies of 17 countries (todays equivalent of $133 billion) and prevent the spread of communism, being touted as “one of the greatest of America's foreign policy successes,” contributing to a "golden age" of economic growth and prosperity in Europe.

 “Churchill’s words won the war, Marshall’s words won the peace.”
	– Dirk Stikker, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1948-1952

In 1947 the USSR developed its own economic recovery program, 
in response to the Marshall Plan, 
refusing the aid which was allocated to them,  
known as the Molotov Plan 🔥💥🍾

The Boeing B-47, the world’s first swept-wing bomber, made its initial flight on Dec. 17, 1947.
It was revolutionary and set the pattern for multi-engine jet aircraft, having a powerful influence on everything that came afterwards. The B-47 was the first to incorporate many advanced features for its time, and was the fastest bomber of the world in the late 1940s. Built to intimidate Russia with the threat of nukes... just in case. Their range, speed, and payload posed the significant threat of optimal explosive delivery and worked as a significant deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The B-47 often took on a second function as a modified reconnaissance aircraft, used for gathering strategic intelligence, flying over the Soviet Union and its allies to collect photographic and electronic intelligence data. A modified version of the aerial vehicle was later designed for this specific purpose, the reconnaissance version, called the RB-47.

![F-47-artist-rendition_(cropped).jpg](/img/user/images/F-47-artist-rendition_(cropped).jpg)

Donald Trump has recently announced that the United States Government has signed a contract with Boeing to put into production the new F-47, supposedly the "most lethal aircraft ever built."

The number 47 was chosen by the US Air Force because "it honors the legacy of the P-47, whose contributions to air superiority during World War II remain historic. Additionally, the number pays tribute to the founding year of the Air Force, while also recognizing the 47th President's pivotal support for the development of the world's first sixth-generation fighter."

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was a heavily armed and exceptionally tough American fighter flown during World War II. Its versatility allowed it to serve effectively as both an escort fighter and later as a devastating ground-attack platform, perhaps the most effective of the conflict. Being one of the most produced Allied fighters, it contributed significantly to their air superiority and ground support operations.

Referring to the up and coming F-47, Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, “We’re going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.”

The engineering and manufacturing development contract, worth more than $20 billion, would be awarded to Boeing. 

Of course, you've heard of their famous and historic Boeing 747, dubbed the 'Queen of the Skies.'
They've also got the Boeing 777, often called the "Triple Seven,"

And of course, yes, the United States Air Force became a separate military service with the implementation of the National Security Act.... in 1947.


![photo_1_banner.jpg](/img/user/images/photo_1_banner.jpg)

On the 18th of September 1947 The National Security Act mandated a major reorganization of the foreign policy and military establishments of the U.S. Government.

Along with the United States Air Force (USAF), this act was responsible for the creation of the Department of Defense(DoD), the National Security Council(NSC), and of course, the infamous Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 🕵️🥸

On June 24, 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed that he saw a string of nine shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour.  This was the first post-World War II sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings. This is the man that invented the term "flying saucer."
	Mt Reinier sits at ~46.8523° N - placing this event, essentially, on the 47th parallel.

# America (fuck yeah)

![download.jpg](/img/user/images/download.jpg)

Of course, we have Donald Trump as the new 47th president of the United States.
This comes along with his Agenda 47, the campaign manifesto that details policies sought to be implemented upon his election. 
His cult following has attempted to take over the number, 
but we will persist in making sure its beauty is not lost. 
All publicity is wonderful.
As you can see, the collective is beginning to prime the subconscious minds of its people in what will eventually be a beautiful widespread gnosis of the number 47.

Elon Musk's Self-driving Model Y SUV came out in 2020 at $47,000.

Elon Musk, through his PAC "Elon's America," launched an initiative offering $47 to registered voters who refer others to sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. This was done in key swing states with an aim to gather one million signatures before the upcoming presidential election. There was a lot of controversy surrounding this, but the initiative is legally permissible as it incentivizes petition referrals, not voter registration or voting itself. 

 The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with help from Senior Advisor Elon Musk(appointed by President Trump), said that it found $4.7 trillion in untraceable Treasury payments that were missing a critical tracking code.

![common-sense-gettyimages-544279022-2.jpg](/img/user/images/common-sense-gettyimages-544279022-2.jpg)

Common Sense is a 47-page pamphlet that was written by Thomas Paine in 1775–1776. It advocated, towards the people of the Thirteen Colonies, a drive towards independence from Great Britain, and the creation of a democratic republic. It is widely considered to have been a significant influence on the Declaration of Independence.

Harvey J. Kaye, author of Thomas Paine and the Promise of America, claims that "most Americans thought _Common Sense_ was the revolutionary document, not the Declaration of Independence,"

 John Adams wrote to his wife in 4-1776, "Common Sense, like a ray of revelation, has come in seasonably to clear our doubts, and to fix our choice."

Some call Thomas "the forgotten founder." He hasn't received as much recognition as other important figures in the Revolution, not even able to secure a statue of himself in the nation's capital. Only 6 people attended Mr. Paine's funeral. 

![Declaration_of_Independence_(1819),_by_John_Trumbull.jpg](/img/user/images/Declaration_of_Independence_(1819),_by_John_Trumbull.jpg)

Declaration of Independence
7-4-1776
	"The draft of the Declaration was revised first by Adams and Franklin, and then by the full committee. A total of 47 alterations, including the insertion of three complete paragraphs, were made to the text before it was presented to Congress on June 28."
		https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9907/jeffdec.html (Directly from the Library of Congress)

The 12-by-18-foot oil-on-canvas painting by the American artist John Trumbull, created in 1818, depicts the presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress, and 47 individuals.

![painting_key_declaration-of-independence_aoc.png](/img/user/images/painting_key_declaration-of-independence_aoc.png)

The earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence is a fragment known as the "Composition Draft". Written in July of 1776, the fragment had been preserved unrecognized in the Library of Congress, that is, until historian Julian P. Boyd reexamined primary documents for his publication in _The Papers of Thomas Jefferson_. The fragment had been mistakenly filed under a September 1777 date(whoops). Heavily edited in Jefferson's clear, precise handwriting, it ended up proving itself to be a key component in unraveling the story of the writing of the Declaration. It turns out that the "Rough Draft" which was thought to be the first edition, was not - this fragment making itself clear as the elder parchment. 

"The Fragment contains several words and passages that are crossed out; none of these was copied into the 'Rough draught' (or true fair copy),"
	-Boyd (in his first volume of _The Papers of Thomas Jefferson_)

Historians had argued that a heavily edited draft must have preceded the copy Jefferson had endorsed as the original rough draft, and now they finally had proof.

When did this discovery occur? 
1947

On June 11th, a committee was appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, consisting of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman. According to John Adams' 1805 Autobiography, this committee first decided on the Declaration's core content and then formed a subcommittee with Jefferson and Adams to handle the actual writing.

Thomas Jefferson, however, disputed this claim, and in his own letter written in 1823 confronts what seems to be a false claim from John Adams. 

"Mr. Adams memory has led him into unquestionable error. At the age of 88 and 47 years after the transactions, . . . this is not wonderful. Nor should I . . . venture to oppose my memory to his, were it not supported by written notes, taken by myself at the moment and on the spot. . . The Committee of 5 met, no such thing as a sub-committee was proposed, but they unanimously pressed on myself alone to undertake the draught. I consented; I drew it; but before I reported it to the committee I communicated it separately to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams requesting their corrections;. . . and you have seen the original paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams interlined in their own handwriting. Their alterations were two or three only, and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the committee, and from them, unaltered to the Congress."

By the early 1820s the original Declaration of Independence, an engrossed parchment document, was already showing significant signs of aging and fading. Concerns grew about its preservation and the need for an exact replica(for posterity purposes). In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, recognizing the deterioration, commissioned William J. Stone, a prominent Washington D.C. engraver, to create a full-size, exact facsimile of the original Declaration. Stone completed the copperplate in 1823 (**47** years after 1776).

# National Treasure 2 

![National-Treasure-page-47.jpg](/img/user/images/National-Treasure-page-47.jpg)

National Treasure 2, a heavily masonic themed movie, features the number with great emphasis.
The movie begins with Nicholas Cage's character, Ben Gates, teaching at a convention. In the midst of his lecture, he is interrupted by an audience member that holds the remnants of an old journal - ultimately changing the story. Supposedly held onto by his family, his ancestry descending from the infamous mason Albert Pike, a black-market treasure dealer has found what is a missing page of the diary of John Wilkes Booth. This piece of paper not only contained secret clues to the location of a lost city of gold(which ends up being in the heads of Mount Rushmore), but it also linked Ben's ancestor Thomas Gates as an accomplice to Booth in what was Lincoln's assassination. Ben determines to solve the puzzle and find the city of gold before this mysterious man, as-well as to set the history straight and restore his families legacy

Eventually we find ourselves in a dramatic moment. Ben Gates has discovered the first part of the map leading to the city of gold. To obtain the other, he must find the second half of an ancient plank of wood coded with inscriptions. No longer hidden in the compartment it was originally stored inside of within the presidential desk(he looked), all they were left with was a symbol etched in its place. 

But the journey wasn't over.

Nicholas Cage sits on the big-screen and reveals the only path forward, "I am going to kidnap the President of the United States." 

You see the symbol was legendary, supposedly representative of a secret shared diary, one written by presidents, for presidents. We're not just talking the assassination of JFK. The 18 1/2 missing minutes of the Watergate tapes. Did the Apollo really land on the moon? What about Area 51... Gates was not sure if it was real or not, that is, until he saw it for himself in the oval office. A legendary confidential notebook, a collection of documents passed down to each U.S. President as they come into their term, containing secrets too dangerous or shocking to reveal to the general public. This is where the second half of the map was to be located.

Only the current president knows where this esoteric literature is kept, each one chooses their own designated hiding place. Ben Gates would only need a few minutes with him... 

The team influences the location which the White House decides to hold the Presidents birthday at, making sure it takes place at Mount Vernon. Here Nicholas Cage lures the president into a secret tunnel, chocked up as a history lesson, closing the doors behind themselves as he reveals his true intentions. Making a plea to the President to provide for him the location of the book, Ben Gates doesn't have much time as the secret service is on their tail.

At first the President denies its existence. Eventually, Nicholas's Cages captivating charisma breaks him down and The Head of State begins to spill the beans. Revealing the hidden coordinates of its location to be in the the library of congress, the treasure hunter is eager to make his way forward. If he isn't successful and does not find the city of gold, changing the course of American history, he will be charged with kidnapping the President...

But before he can go, the President stops him. 
"I want you to do something for me...
	
	"It would be a priveledge, sir"

"Page 47. Just have a look at that"

Thomas Gates goes on and finds the book, the city of gold, and accomplishes all that he set out to do.

Nation Treasure 2 ends with a cliffhanger.
In the epilogue of the film, the President and Gates rub shoulders again.

The President commends Ben for his service to the country and thanks him, before revealing the headline of the next day's newspaper which will ultimately clear his ancestor Thomas Gate's from any involvement in the assassination of Lincoln. He is also cleared of charges for kidnapping the President.

Mission accomplished. 

But before the movie ends.

The President asks,

"I mean, I am curious about that favor I asked you.
Any report regarding what's on page 47?"

*staring into his soul not blinking a single time during the 8 second delivery as his head turns slightly while ominous background music rises in the background

"I believe I can help with that sir"

"So it's good?"

*the camera zooms in on Nicholas Cage's face as they continue to make intense eye contact

"Life altering sir"

The president nods Nicholas Cage to join him as they walk away - they seem to be in an airplane hangar, perhaps to a plane, to discuss the matter more

The sidekick which joined Ben Gates along his journey, cries out 

"What's on page 47? Are you talking about the book?"

The president turns back 

"What book?"

There are many thoughts as to what the page's contents could be, it was heavily theorized to be the premise for National Treasure 3 if it were to ever go into development. Unfortunately it seems that National Treasure 3 will never come into the light of day, having been buried by Disney, but they did release a short series on Disney Plus in 2022. 

In it they threw a nod towards the number

We may never know.

# Freemasonry

![3061.jpg](/img/user/images/3061.jpg)

Euclid's 47th problem, also known as Proposition 47 in Euclid's Elements, is the Pythagorean theorem: in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. It holds profound symbolic and practical significance in Freemasonry, intertwining mathematical truth with philosophical ideals. Represented by three squares forming a 3:4:5 right triangle, this geometric principle (a2+b2=c2) demonstrates how to "square a square,"  symbolic for restoring balance and order. Its mathematical certainty reflects the immutability of moral and natural laws. The fact that it exists mean there is structure to the universe. It is the root of all geometry. It is behind the discovery of every mathematical unknown from two known factors. It is the very cornerstone of mathematics. 

Though attributed to Euclid, the theorem’s roots trace to Pythagoras, whose work influenced early Masonic reverence for geometry as a divine science. Numbers were the most divine thing to the Pythagoreans.

"All is number"
	-Pythagoras

Pythagoreans were famous for their teachings, but also their secrecy.
Once someone became a Pythagorean, there were less and less questions, fewer answers, and more riddles - much like the world of masonry. 

The word "geometry" originates from the Ancient Greek word "geōmetria,"
Gē=Earth, land
metria/metron=a measuring of

Through the use of geometry, one can trace nature, following her to discover the power, wisdom and goodness that operates under our nose as the universal principles orchestrating our reality. 
By picking up on the laws of our world one can view with delight the magnificence with which this vast machine governs itself and maintains order. Through geometry, we trace the movements of the planets in their respective orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions; through geometry, we account for the change of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays. It is an observation of God's beautiful proportions, and the masons take on the task to observe the perfect symmetry of this divine artist in order to emulate and take on some of its attributes inside of their own life. The 47th Problem of Euclid inspires Masons to be great lovers of the Arts and Sciences.

Ultimately, the 47th problem was not even a discovery of Pythagoras. 
The earliest proof of the mathematical ratio comes from Babylonia on clay tablets dated to
around 1800 BC. We also have Egyptian papyri from around the same time which has a mathematical problem, whose solution is a Pythagorean triple of 6 8 and 10, and clearly displays a
triangle. Not only in those places, but also in India, between the 8th and fifth centuries BC, we have sutras which contain lists of Pythagorean triples and even a statement of the Pythagorean theorem.

The first reference to the 47th Problem of Euclid or Pythagoras in a masonic context was in Dr James Anderson's constitution, published in 1723, considered to be one of the most important works in the history of the Freemasonry. In it he states “The Greater Pythagoras, provided the Author of the 47th Proposition of Euclid’s first Book, which, if duly observed, is the Foundation of all Masonry, sacred, civil, and military…”

Within the Masonic lodge itself, this symbolism finds resonance. The numbers three, four, and five are built into the lodge's structure and officers, the points of entrance, and the very arrangement of the three burning tapers around the altar, which can symbolically form this right triangle. It exists all over the place in their symbology.

The 3-4-5 triangle is the simplest demonstration of the theorem.

"Moses" (משה)

"B'shagam" (בְּשָׁגָם) 
	 "for he is also flesh"
		The rest of verse Genesis 6:3 ends with,  "yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."
			Although not explicitly referencing the man, this is seen by Rabbis to be the first  esoteric introduction to Moses, who's ship sailed at that age, especially given the matching 345 gematria. We know this because people continued to live past 120 for centuries after that statement in Genesis, so it could not have referred to everyone in general.

Why was Moses’ life capped at 120? What was his fatal flaw?

In the ancient text _Sefer HaPeliyah_, it reminds us that this occurred because God tells Moses to speak to a rock, promising to make water flow in the desert again. However, Moses strikes the rock instead of speaking to it. Because of just this one thing, God tells Moses that he will no longer be permitted to bring the people into the Promised Land.

_Rabbi Isaac Luria_ (1534-1572), foundational Kabbalistic figure, universally known as the Arizal, brought this to an even deeper level. He claimed that Moses’ name is 345 because he contained 345 spiritual sparks. Of these 345 sparks, they split into two directions. 

The first 37, from Abel (הבל), viewed by the Arizal as the reincarnation of Moses, with gematria value of 37.

# Action

![57747g1.jpg](/img/user/images/57747g1.jpg)
	Yoshitoshi Tsukioka (Taiso) 1839-1892
		Part of the Seichu Gishi Meimei Den series, capturing the Chushingura (47 Ronin)

The story of the 47 Ronin, also known as the Akō incident/vendetta, is one of Japan's most iconic tales. It revolves around a group of samurai who became rōnin (masterless warriors) after their lord, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) for attacking a court official, Kira Yoshinaka, in retaliation of an insult. Stripped of their status and bound by the samurai code of _bushidō_, the 47 Ronin swore to avenge their master's death. Over the course of nearly two years, they meticulously planned their attack, ultimately infiltrating Kira's mansion on a snowy night in January 1703. They killed Kira and carried his severed head to Asano's grave as proof of their loyalty and justice. Rather than fleeing, they surrendered to authorities and were sentenced to commit _seppuku_, dying with honor. Their actions have since been immortalized in Japanese culture as a symbol of the unwavering samurai spirit

The movie version of _47 Ronin_ includes a protagonist Keanu Reeves, whom grows up raised by Tengu, spirit demons, who taught him their fighting ways after he was abandoned by his mother. He grows up to leave them and abandon his special dark powers. Later in the film Keanu Reeves's character, now enlisted to help the ronin, leads them back to the place of his origins, where he and the samurai must go to get their hands on the mystical swords of the Tengu, imbued with power that will help them avenge Lord Asano. Engaging in tests of will to prove their worthiness, Keanu fighting a shapeshifting lizard man, they are able to face all odds and obtain their weapons. This reminds me of what Nathan of Gaza describes in his Zohar analysis - the Treatise of the Dragon, in the descent to the Qlippoth.

At the end of the movie, there is another potential Kabbalistic link to be seen. The outcasted warrior Kai (Keanu Reeves) is forced into a deadly duel with the emperors best warrior, the Samurai _Golem_(played by actor Neil Fingleton who stands at 7'7). 

Keanu Reeves later goes on to, in a similar theme, become known as the legendary warrior-assassin John Wick.

Agent 47 is the central character of the _Hitman_ franchise, a series of stealth-based video games developed by IO Interactive. He is a genetically-engineered assassin, the 47th clone created from the DNA of five notorious criminals, designed to be the perfect killer. This was done in the hopes of creating an army full of obedient soldiers to carry out their commands. As one of the last clones to be created, 47 has his skills quite refined, and manages to escape his creators. Known for the barcode tattoo on the back of his head and his signature black suit with a red tie, Agent 47 works for the International Contract Agency (ICA), carrying out high-profile assassinations with precision and stealth. Beyond its gaming success, Hitman expanded into two film adaptations (Hitman in 2007 and Hitman: Agent 47 in 2015), as well as a series of comics and two novels.

# Writing

![Ficino,_Pimander.jpg](/img/user/images/Ficino,_Pimander.jpg)

The Corpus Hermeticum was translated into latin and published by Marsilio Ficino in 1471 for the first time. This was a pivotal moment in the Renaissance as it introduced these ancient texts, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, to a wider audience. Influencing the thought and culture of the time, this translation made significant contributions to the study and revival of Alchemy and Magic. Ficino's translation, along with his preface outlining Hermes Trismegistus's life and writings, is considered the starting point of what became known as the Hermetic tradition - and could even be seen as the seed which birthed Western Esotericism. The task was so important that he was pulled off his work on translating Plato's dialogues to work on the Corpus Hermeticum first, although his identity remained primarily as a Platonist. 

Ficino's most important philosophical work was his magnum opus - Theologia Platonica de immortalitate animae (Platonic Theology, On the Immortality of the Soul). The book was finished in 1474, but did not find its way into print until 1482. Considered by many modern scholars to be the most characteristic work of Renaissance philosophy, it was the first major system of theology in the Western tradition constructed primarily around the study of the soul. Ficino made Plato accessible, possible for the first time in centuries, and integrated Platonic thought into the cultural and intellectual fabric of his time

Who is it, then, that would be the first philosopher mage to fully identify with the work of the Hermticum? Well, it was the person who, obviously quite intrigued, translated _three additional_ Hermetic texts that were _not_ in the manuscript Ficino had worked from. The poet Lodovico Lazzarelli, born in 1447, is who we can look at as the initial individual to refer to himself as a Hermeticist, the first Hermetic philosopher in European history. His work the Crater Hermetis (The Mixing Bowl of Hermes) is also the first true work of Hermetic Philosophy in Europe. It is in this text, which was published 7 years after his death on ****uhm**** June 23, 1500, that we find the 3 additional texts which added to Ficino's 14 translations(totaling 17, sometimes 18 for those who had their hands on the Asclepius.)

The Four-Seven Debate 

The Four-Seven Debate was one of the longest-running and insightful controversies in the history of Korean Confucianism. The basic problem concerned the nature and relationship between the Four Sprouts, first described by Mengzi, and the Seven Emotions, depicted in a variety of classical texts such as the _Doctrine of the Mean_. The question was: Are the Four Sprouts emotions or pure principle? If they are emotions, how can they remain as impeccable moral standards and avoid the possibility of leading one into moral error? If they are not emotions, how can they function to inspire and motivate good action and moral cultivation?
	Sounds as though they naturally picked up on many of the brain systems which Panksepp discovered in his research. Aswell, it seems that the four sprouts seem to be aspects of self which are able to control our intrinsic biological affective nature.

I had a gardening co-worker named Pamela that was born in 1974. She was living with someone that was born in 1947. She was a lot of fun to get to know, and on a tour at her place of residence she began to tell my coworker and I about a story that she had where she was tripping on mushrooms sitting on a friends porch - floating around the planet Saturn - until they snapped her back to reality, waking her up from a sort of trance, appearing dissociated to them.

At the time I was powering through [[The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] , with a heightened awareness on the planet Saturn at the moment, as-well as the council of nine. When she began to relay this story back to me it felt as though there was certainly some sort of purpose for her in sharing this to me. I was even thinking that maybe in some way Ra / the council was trying to perhaps inspire some sort of channeling attempt with her as the instrument, myself organizing it. I wasn't certain - but I told her a little bit about the whole book series, given she was really into extraterrestrial stuff - introducing it but not going too deep. I went home and was going to send her the first part of the channeling series that they uploaded of the actual contact - and when I pulled up the YouTube video I was met with this(I didn't play the clock either.)

# aha!

Eventually there was one point, after my yoga training had come to a close, in which I was quite fed up. Around January-February of 2023. I was completely annoyed with this number having become the foothold from which my eyes peered into the world from. What is it I could have missed? This trail I have been following has felt so real, as though it were guiding my soul. Surely there must be something to this all. But alas, I know that I am fallible. I was ready to accept the fact that it was nothing that special and I was struggling with some mental health issues. I wanted to get back to my life, no longer to be driven by this neurotic search. I understood the kundalini training could have brought me to a literal kind of psychosis, in which the importance of the number heightened, that I would have to work with myself as I was. We would have to be honest and not paint over anything with pretty colors. I decided to try my hand at an MDMA solo session, in efforts to release whatever trauma was driving this unending obsession. Perhaps I just needed to feel some love, move some energy, and calm myself down. I put on some random classic romance playlist as the drug was coming up. I listened to the music and meditated as I began to feel all sorts of emotions. Eventually I found myself, at some point in this process, somewhat dissociated, all of sudden on my phone. I was staring down at the Wikipedia page for the number 47. I really cannot stop, I must mutter this number in my sleep. Well, I was going to lovingly, once and for all, see if there was anything substantial about this. Let whatever part of me that is desiring this hunt to have its fun for a moment without any judgement, maybe if I'm to let go we find something miraculous, if not, then we let him see, look, just a number, no weird feelings, lets just move forward. Next thing you know I have the idea to go down a path I hadn't before. What about the year 47? Okay, well we've got B.C. and A.D. to look at. Alright, so 47 A.D. , I look around a little bit, nothing I can see that is real special.  Then I click 47 B.C., and scroll for a second until I see a familiar date, June 23rd. My birthday. Uh oh.  "It's All Coming Back to Me" playing in the background, I sit there with my jaw dropped. I look a little further and see my father and brother having similar dates to their relatives. A part of me instantly tunes into a profound wonderous emotion of recognition, another is concerned that I have got to be under the influence of some sort of psychosis generating demonic spirit, and yet another just can't even begin to think or conceptualize any of the emotions that are being experienced. Feeling as though this is too crazy to be real... but I'm being forced to look at it directly in the face, I can't take it anymore before I have to just lay down and let Celine's magnificent voice wash over me...

Just earlier this month, before I had done any sort of gematria on her name, my Mom took me to go to lunch with her and my Grandma. During the consumption of sushi, I attempted to relay all that was coming to me(without sounding like she would have to check me into a hospital). Having tried getting into things a little before, what I was saying never seemed to truly land or connect. Trying to explain things to my brother on another occasion, you could see the sadness in his eyes as he looked at his sibling too far gone - that I had completely lost myself in the sauce. At lunch I showed my Mom all the birthdates and started explaining everything to her, she was open and curious, I don't even think she knew who Cleopatra really was. We went to Grocery Outlet(the Bargain Market) and picked up some salsa right afterwards.

Last week, after researching further into what the 777 associated with her name could mean, I discovered that in the bible there were 2 Lamechs, one of which lived to 777 years. Trying to learn more, I found myself on a Quora answer with 777 views.

I was born and raised in Spokane Washington, which lies along the 47th parallel.

The creators of [[CIMBS\|CIMBS]] are located in Seattle Washington, which also lies along the 47th parallel.

In 2006, Jaak Panksepp, author of [[Archaeology of Mind\|Archaeology of Mind]] moved to Pullman Washington to accept the Bernice and Joseph Baily Chair in Animal Well-Being in the College of Veterinary Medicine, right below the 47th parallel.

One of the interesting details about this individual, Ptolemy Caesar, is that he is espoused to be, in some conspiracy theories, to actually be the "legitimate" story of Jesus. Now, for a young man experiencing some transcendent phenomenon, this sort of theoretical mystique surrounding, what you believe to be a past life of yourself, only makes things worse. Now lets imagine that the address you live at is quite literally 420 (Mother Mary) E. Joseph (Father Joseph) on the street of Providence Holy Family Hospital - equipped with an enormous Cross.

		 the story of Jesus' final 47 days on Earth. 

My card failed trying to buy groceries. Someone ended up buying them for me. Feeling blessed I entered into a 2 hour conversation with a homeless man in front of the Natural Grocers. Actually one of the best talks I've had with someone. This took shortly after leaving my dishwashing job(not telling him this), and he happened to share with me his favorite song "Jesus Does the Dishes."

Going to the library to silently read a book, after work at said dishwashing job, a woman sits down next to me and breaks the silence "Do you know Jesus?" and begins to, for the next 40 minutes, in the silence of the library, preach to me. She was very nice. I'm glad the people at AT&T were able to help get her phone working. Of course we all have come across enthusiastic Christians, but this experience was just so profoundly odd it was as if she was part of the worlds attempt to gaslight me into this weird messiah madness. 


The last miracle Jesus performed before his crucifixion and resurrection was healing Malchus's ear. It does not describe the restoration of this auditory intake device within Mark, only in Luke, making this the only line which mentions it in the text.  
	Mark 14:47 “Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.”

## Receipts

I found myself stumbling upon this receipt in my cherished Channel 5 merch hoodie, one I had not worn in about 4-5 months. Searching the pockets of every clothing item which I owned, in search of one of my andara crystals - so that I could hold it in my left hand during meditation ([[The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] secret), suddenly I found myself stepping into the remembrance of a profound moment. As my hand came across a folded note and opened it up it all came back to me. I had gone to the bank to withdraw cash, in efforts to procure for myself the strongest oil infused marijuana joint that money could buy (for maybe $5). Lying in the dispenser responsible for printing receipts was a piece of inked thermal paper, left unwanted by the previous ATM attendee. Upon it was a unique pair of numbers which had a frightening significance for me. A remaining balance stood at 2000.47, the first half of the digits the year which I was born, the second.. also... the year in which I was born? I find it worth mentioning, that it seems the date on which this occurred was the night of Halloween - where the veil between the two worlds is supposedly its thinnest.

Here's another one I got on a trip to the Burlington Coat Factory the summer after the training ended. I bought some crocs that I was considering using for gardening, but ultimately decided that they wouldn't really be the best workwear - refunding it afterwards. However, why did I even feel that it was a decent option in the first place? looking back I was just following the flow not really thinking too thoroughly about things.

On one of the glorious ritualistic trips to Panera Bread I love to share with my grandmother - a few times a year - we happened to get the special number. This was earlier in the journey where I was actually very terrified about my mental health and obsession with the number, being with my sweet Grandma made it feel safe - a sign to keep going even though it felt I was entering a prolonged psychosis of the Jim Carrey Number 23 variety.

3/30/2023 One of the co-workers I had at a Thai restaurant which I washed dishes at, right after my kundalini training had finished, while we were sitting down eating lunch, randomly remarked that she only had $0.47 in her bank account. 
![IMG_0441.png| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_0441.png)
Just a month earlier, on 2/28/2023 my own bank account was looking at a similar sum




4x7=28, roughly the cycle of the moon 

_The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are 47 degrees of latitude apart_.

The solar system is flat, with the planets orbiting the sun on the same plane, known as the ecliptic. **Earth rotates on an axis tilted by 23.4 degrees with respect to this ecliptic, causing the sun to rise and set within almost 47 degrees** — a range it gradually covers over an entire year.

Approximately 71 days before and after inferior conjunction, Venus reaches a position called elongation, when the planet lies at its greatest angular distance from the Sun, which is about 47 degrees. At eastern elongation it is the Evening Star, and can be seen for up to a few hours after sunset before setting to the west. When it is at its western elongation, it becomes the Morning Star, visible to the eastern horizon up to a few hours before dawn.

"But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
	Revelation 2:25

 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
	Revelation 22:16

"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!"
	Isaiah 14:12 (KJV)

"How you have fallen from heaven, you star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, you who defeated the nations!"
	Isaiah 14:12 (NASB)

Lucifer, in the Isaiah quote, being interchanged with morning star amongst different biblical editions.

If we pay attention to those two passages, we see that both Jesus, and Lucifer, are designated as "The Morning Star."

(The Morning Star, or "Day Star" refers to the Planet Venus in the Sky)

We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
	2 Peter 1:19-21

Before we continue it should be noted that the work of [[The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] comes from a 6th dimensional collective consciousness which supposedly evolved out of Venus. 

In both English and Simple Gematria, Jesus and Lucifer have the exact same numerical quantity.

Alright what the fuck



כִּי-טוֹב (ki-tov)It is good / For it is good / Light
20 + 10 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 47

Hebrew name Shani (שָׁנִי) means "scarlet" or "crimson"

Scarlet, the color of blood, represents life and the shedding of blood required for atone ment for sin. Metaphorically, its intensity represents the depth of sin that requires divine intervention to cleanse. Its use in the Tabernacle, Temple, priestly garments, and purification rituals links _Shani_ directly to holiness, sacred space, and the processes of atonement and becoming ritually pure.

The famous historian Flavius Josephus (born 37 A.D.) noted that the shani dye symbolized fire, one of the four basic elements of the world 
	"**and the scarlet will be the symbol of fire.**"
		_Antiquities of the Jews_, Book 3, Chapter 7, Section 7 (Paragraph 183)

The most direct reference is in Joshua 2.
Rahab, a Canaanite prostitute living in Jericho hid two spies from the Israelite army when they came to scout the city. She did this because she had heard of the mighty God of Israel and believed in His power. As a promise of protection for her and her family, the spies told Rahab to tie a scarlet thread to her window. This would serve as a visible sign to the Israelites that her house was to be spared when they attacked Jericho. So... she hangs a scarlet cord from her window. 
This act saves her and her family when Jericho is destroyed, prefiguring salvation through faith in the blood of Christ. Faith in Jesus, like Rahab's faith in the God of Israel, can lead to forgiveness and eternal life.

Rahab, saved by the scarlet symbol, later married into the tribe of Judah and became an ancestor of the 'Messiah,' showing God's willingness to extend mercy and grace even to those outside of His chosen people. Rahab, a foreigner and a woman of questionable reputation, was saved and even became part of the lineage of Jesus Christ.

During the Second Temple era, it was tradition that a scarlet thread, made from wool, was fastened to the door of the temple, and later tied to the head of the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement. Once all the commandments had been scrupulously followed, it is written in ancient literature that this scarlet thread would miraculously become white. It was taken as a sign that God was pleased with the sacrifices, giving reassurance to the people of Israel and that their sin had been successfully atoned for as a nation.

Christians believe that this symbolic crimson thread ultimately culminates in Jesus. His sacrificial death on the cross and shed blood are seen as the ultimate fulfillment, providing redemption and salvation for all of Israel/ those who believe.

“Come now, let us reason together, says the Lord:
though your sins are like scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow;
though they are red like crimson,
they shall become like wool."
	   Isaiah 1:18 (ESV)


![kermesjpg.jpg](/img/user/images/kermesjpg.jpg)

Another layer to the significance of _shani_ (scarlet) involves understanding the source of the dye itself. In the Hebrew Bible, the term often appears combined as _tola'at shani_ (תּוֹלַעַת שָׁנִי), literally translating to "worm of scarlet" or "scarlet worm." This refers to the _coccus ilicis_, or Kermes ilicis, or simply kermes, a genus of gall-like scale insects from the Kermesidae family (belonging to the superfamily Coccoidea), that feeds on Quercus coccifera, the similarly named kermes oak, primarily in the Mediterranean region.  
	The Old Testament Hebrew uses two different words for “worm.” One word is _rimmah_ (רִמָּה), which can point to any worm, but more or less often refers to a maggot - symbolically referencing decay. The other term, tola'ah, can also refer to any worm, but in most contexts, particularly poetic ones(which there is no lack of within the bible), it was a very specific reference to the scarlet worm.
		The English word "crimson" traces back through Spanish, Latin, and Arabic (_qirmiz_) to Persian roots related to _kirm_ ("worm"), The ultimate source may be Sanskrit कृमिज _kṛmi-jā_ meaning "worm-made".

Historically, cochineal was used in the production of textiles. The dried female insects, and what was inside of them, carminic acid, became an important international commodity. There was a research study conducted by Professors at Bar Ilan University of Israel in 2005. This was done in efforts to prove that the source of Shani, crimson dye, was local to Israel, that the local tola worm was in-fact the source of this colorful pigment, not being imported from elsewhere. The last research done on the species, prior to this one, was an article released by M. Sternlicht in 1969. In his dissertation he developed a new method for classifying coccoids, and he illustrated three kermes species that were found in Israel: Kermes biblicus = Kermes palestinensis, K. echinatus, and Kermes spatulatus. 

![kermesbiblicus.jpg](/img/user/images/kermesbiblicus.jpg)

Unfortunately, it seems that "Attempts to produce a dye from the K. biblicus coccoid, considered the most likely source for a dye, were unsuccessful," despite its gematria(close enough). 

However, they "discovered that K. echinatus contains a significant amount of bright red pigment and is a parasite of the local evergreen kermes oak." 

Later going on to solidfy their position, "These results confirm the presence of Ka in K. echinatus extracts. The fact that this scale is found in Israel suggests that the origin of the shani color mentioned in the Bible could have been local and not an import from abroad, as most scholars have assumed. Our hypothesis is supported by the color quality of Ka, the relative concentration of the pigment in K. echinatus, and the abundance of the K. echinatus scale in Israel."
	(Ka=Kermesic Acid, in Ancient Egypt Ka the was a vital essence or life force that existed independently of the physical body.)
		[The Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240297565_The_Scarlet_Dye_of_the_Holy_Land)

![echinatus.jpg](/img/user/images/echinatus.jpg)

Early in her life cycle, the female _Kermes_ insect undertakes an important journey as a small 'crawler'. Her mission during this mobile phase is to explore and select a suitable location on an oak twig where she will attach herself permanently to mature and eventually reproduce. This is a permanent decision, there is finality here, and she does it all without any eyes. Male insects have wings and are always forced to meet with the females at their own place of residency. 

![kermesmature.png](/img/user/images/kermesmature.png)

Once the deed has been done, eggs are laid and develop in the space directly underneath the mother's body, enclosed by her hardened outer scale covering. Her internal tissues are in direct contact with the eggs. The mother then dies, and these insides naturally begin to decompose, breaking down cells and liquifying over time. The crimson pigment (kermesic acid) is located within these tissues. As the cells break down, the pigment would be released and become part of the fluid mix resulting from decomposition. Since the eggs are packed tightly within this space, the decomposing, pigmented fluid from the mother's tissues would inevitably come into contact with the outer surface of the eggs. Therefore, it's very likely that as the mother's insides decay, the resulting pigmented fluids seep onto, mix with, and bathe the eggs contained beneath her. It is primarily _after_ the young have departed that the remaining, now empty, structure undergoes its final stages of decay and weathering, eventually breaking down and flaking off the tree it has been hosted upon.

![kermesbirth.png](/img/user/images/kermesbirth.png)

The motherly worms act of fixing herself to the wood is seen as a direct parallel to Christ being nailed to the wooden cross, where he was fixed until death. Her passing is intrinsically linked to the sheltering and future hatching of her offspring, interpreted as mirroring Christ's sacrificial death on the cross. She gives her life so her offspring might live.

"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed."
	Peter 2:24 (ESV)

As the mother dies, the crimson substance (kermesic acid) becomes apparent, being strongly associated with Christ's shed blood. The interpretation is that just as the crimson covers the eggs, Christ's blood was shed for the atonement of sins, cleansing believers. The dead mother's hardened body remains on the branch, physically sheltering the vulnerable eggs beneath her through harsh conditions (like winter). This is seen as symbolizing the protection believers receive from judgment or spiritual harm through the covering provided by Christ's sacrifice. In the spring, the young crawlers hatch and emerge from under the protective covering of the dead mother. This is often likened to the new life believers receive through Christ – a spiritual resurrection or new birth made possible by his death. Some versions of the interpretation also focus on the fact that the decaying shell of the mother insect can eventually bleach and turn white or whitish, symbolizing the complete purification from sin - even touting that it shares a similar 3 day timeline(from the departure of the young), similar to Jesus's resurrection. Scientifically, the timeline for this decay is highly variable, dependent on environmental factors like weather, and is not fixed at three days, though a coincidental timing in some instances isn't completely impossible. While the biological process isn't one of active bleeding, the reality of her pigmented bodily fluids bathing the eggs during decomposition provides a tangible basis for this symbolic interpretation - albeit un-necessary, as they are already bursting with color from the Kermesic acid flowing through their little bodies. One final parallel is that the kermes insect has to _die_ in order to be of any use to humans. The crimson color cannot be extracted without the death of the worm, the powder of their dead bodies being crushed and ground is what produces the material for the hue. These facts directly parallel the Messiah, who had to die in order to see a harvest of God's kingdom.

"Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,
    and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,
he will see his offspring and prolong his days,
    and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand."
	    Isaiah 53:10

The color of the robe placed on Jesus during his crucifixion has long been debated, not that he cared much about making fashion statement(with a crown of thorns to match - where was GQ at?). Matthew describes it as "scarlet" (Matthew 27:28), contrasting with Mark and John’s "purple" (Mark 15:17; John 19:2). While purple symbolized royalty in the ancient world, acting as a cruel parody of Jesus’ budding reputation, those around him claiming "King of the Jews," Matthew’s specific use of "scarlet" (Using the Greek term _kokkinos_) seems to align with a deeper underlying theme. While scarlet also was a symbol of wealth and luxury, it's dye being expensive to produce, _kokkinos_(κοκκίνος) stems directly from the word _kokkos_(κόκκος), meaning "kernel" or "grain". Its use in relation to the color scarlet stems directly from the appearance and harvesting of the kermes insect, which form a kernel shaped pods, clusters of the eggs from the female insect.

"Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."
		John 12:24

![r0_0_4182_3571_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg](/img/user/images/r0_0_4182_3571_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg)

In Mark, after being humiliated throughout the town and then nailed to the cross,
"Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” 
	Mark 15:34 

This line has significance, as it is the opener to Psalms, which is dated by scholars to be hundreds of years prior to Jesus's arrival on the scene. Many Christians view this as being prophetic, that Jesus's mission was written in years before his birth, he is the true messiah and has been in the plan all along this entire time. This, however, seems to fall a bit short when we consider the actual text in its depth, as-well as the historical background which went into the writing of Mark. The authors very well could have gone in afterwards placing these famous words from Psalms in Jesus's mouth to fit their own narrative, himself never uttering such a phrase. It is also a possibility that, as a studied Rabbi, Jesus was in-fact educated on the Psalms. Part of this confusion stems from Psalm 22:16, and whether the original Hebrew word was כָּאֲרִי (_ka'ari_), meaning "like a lion", or a variant like כארו (_ka'aru_), interpreted as "they pierced" or "they dug through". This translation difference is significant because the "pierced my hands and feet" reading is seen by Christians as a direct prophecy of Jesus's crucifixion, while the "Like a lion, they are at _my hands_ and my feet" reading offers a different image, one which seems to enhance the metaphor already being described through the Psalm.

I would argue, however, that given the specific context we have just developed, there is still a subtle prophetic element to it all. When we consider that just a few lines earlier, in Psalms 22:6, it states...

"But I am a worm and not a man,  
    scorned by mankind and despised by the people."
	    Psalm 22:6
	    
The script used for writing Hebrew during the First Temple period was **Paleo-Hebrew**.
Often called “Early _Hebrew_” or “Old Negev,” the letter _Tav_ had been depicted looking almost exactly like what becomes the Christian cross.

![lettertav.jpg](/img/user/images/lettertav.jpg)

While precise dating is difficult, many scholars believe Psalm 22 originates from the **First Temple period**. It is highly plausible, and even probable, that when Psalm 22:6 was _originally composed and first written down_, it would have been written using the Paleo-Hebrew script

![iamaworm.png](/img/user/images/iamaworm.png)

When exchange the Tav from the word 
Therefore, the word as it appears in the passage could be said to be encoded with the idea of a sacrificial worm connected to the cross. This is a bit of a stretch, admittedly, but I found it to be a neat addition to the theme which has been built. 

![Iamawormcross.png](/img/user/images/Iamawormcross.png)

One final usage of the worm within the Bible comes from a quote by Jesus,

“And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”
	Isaiah 66:24

This phrasing could be seen as placing a value judgement upon the worms of our world. If a worm were to not die, it would continue to consume endlessly until its death, much like that nature of man. The death of the Tola worm, its sacrificial nature for its young, as opposed to other worms, demonstrates that its essence is ultimately selfless service - paralleling Jesus. To have your worm die would be a release into the realm of the spirit, what Jesus attempts to demonstrate as the path for man.

"Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
	John 12:25–26 (ESV)


![Shani_Deva.jpg|400](/img/user/images/Shani_Deva.jpg)

In Hinduism, Shani, or Shanaishchara, is considered the "God of Time" as well as the God of karma, justice, and retribution.
He is also called _Saneeswar/Shaneeswar_ meaning "Lord of Saturn," and is the personification of the planet Saturn. 
Shani is believed to be an incarnation of Krishna, atleast in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, where Krishna claims that he is "Shani among planets."

Kali is the female deity associated with Saturn. I explain some of my profoundly intimate experience with Kali in [[𖥱 Dedication\|𖥱 Dedication]]. To summarize, my second time chanting the Kali mantra I totaled my car into a woman whose license plate is the same gematria value as Revelations 7:4 (the one specifically mentioning the 144,000). My license plate is AZZ, similar to Azazel, the scapegoat.

Cronos was the ancient Greek - first born and leader of the titans; associated with the harvest, agriculture, and the Golden Age. Cronus was later adopted as the Roman deity Saturn, also solidifying a day of the week, Saturday.

Chronos, quite similar in spelling, was different, being the primordial essence of time itself, its personification. Eventually, within greek culture, the two merged and blended into one another. 

Hesiod: Works and Days is the first work which explores this Golden Age of Saturn.
It was thought of

We first see the importance of the number 144/144,000 showing up in the final book of the New Testament, a work by John the Apostle. Originally written in Greek, it derives its title from the first word of the text - apokalypsis, meaning 'unveiling,' 'disclosure,' or 'revelation.'

![apokalypsos.png](/img/user/images/apokalypsos.png)

In the Book of Revelations, there is a prophecy foretold that there will be 144,000 “sealed” by God. That is, 12,000 members from each of the 12 tribes of Israel, supposed to be saved from the rapture and redeemed from the Earth when the gates of hell are opened. 

Some interpret this to mean that the 144,000 will be recently converted Jewish evangelists, becoming Christian’s who are protected by the wrath of God at the end of times. High priests, endowed with special power to be an elite missionary force. They are sealed and won’t be harmed by the destruction to come. The word ‘seal’ has a very interesting historical background behind it. One of the purposes of sealing in the ancient world, was to authenticate contracts, laws, invoices, treaties, and military orders (amongst other things). Today we use signatures, but in ancient times, kings and rulers wore metal rings that were engraved with their name, initials, or some sort of imagery representing themselves. To seal a document, a bit of wet clay or hot wax would be placed on the opening fold of the paper. Then the ring would be pressed into the wax/clay, leaving the seal’s imprint on it. The document was thereby officially identified with and under the authority of the person to whom, what they referred to as a signet, belonged. Seals were related to ownership, authenticity, security and authority. Any person but the king who broke or disturbed that seal would likely have forfeited their life in exchange.

In this way, the 144,000 has been interpreted to be under the ownership of God, his chosen servants. Imbued with the seal of the Holy Spirit to help bring sinners to Jesus Christ, they are tasked with preaching the gospel endlessly throughout the first half of the brutal 7 year apocalyptic Tribulation period. The reception of the Holy Spirit is a seal of ownership in two senses – the first being God’s ownership over oneself, but the second, one’s ownership over their portion of the heavenly inheritance. These are the individuals who will inherit the New Earth, mind you. Before the angels begin unleashing God’s fury on the world, they must seal up the 144,000 for protection. Once this has been achieved, the four winds of God’s wrath will be released, and the Great Tribulation begins. Dun dun duuuuun

“After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the Earth, holding back the four winds of the Earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels _who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:_ ‘Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees _until_ we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.’ Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.”
	Revelations 7:1-4

Another interpretation, however, is that the 144,000 is simply symbolic. It is referring to all Christians. Numbers in apocalyptic literature were intended to be read without upholding them to exact precision. 12 is a holy number. It is **a symbol of faith, the church, and divine government**. In total, it appears 187 times in the Bible. It reflects the 12 months in a lunar year. There are 12 tribes of Israel, descending from the 12 sons of Jacob. Jesus chose to have 12 apostles. A lot of holiness surrounding this number. 144 is 12 times 12. So if 12 is really holy, then 144 is like… holy squared. If ancient authors wanted to signify a lot of people, they would say 1,000. So 12,000…. that’s a buuuunch of people. The 144,000 is simply a plethora of holy individuals, made up from each of the Tribes of Israel.

This particular section of the text gives evidence for this second perspective.

"After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
	Revelation 7:9-10

It can also be interpolated that this influx of individuals, which can’t be accounted for, is resultant of the original 144,000 witnesses having worked their magic. Their attempts to evangelize the world, helping to convert their fellow man as it crumbles, ultimately being fruitful.

One of the more modern spiritual interpretations, outside of the realm of the Religious, is that the 144,000 is not a literal number of people, but it is simply in reference to all - not Christians - but individuals whom have achieved a level of consciousness in which they see the nature of unity in all things. This frame served as the basis for what evolved further, being remodeled and revised into the modern new age interpretation which we see prevalent today - that the 144,000 are "Starseeds." These are celestial volunteers descend from ascended worlds/realms, spawning inside of the Earthly sphere to provide their higher level of consciousness as a support, in service to help others on their journey of ascension. They have incarnated into the physical human form with a dormant mission at hand, to wake everyone up. This, theoretically, will raise the collective consciousness level of the planet, and we will, at some point, be living in a world that is refined from its inadequacies - a New Earth. The spinning rock we find ourselves on, being polished, is described as a restored and perfected version of the Garden of Eden, a return to a renewed and even more glorious paradise, one where sin and suffering no longer exist.

Here the New Agers still end up running into this same issue of a number which seems itself to quite limiting, 144,000. Of course we run into the spiritual trap which is presented as-well - am I one of the special advanced chosen ones? Ohhhh life is so hard, I'm not from here - I am a brave, honorable, selfless warrior from a foreign land - not built for this place. Take me to your leader, I have come bringing my advanced frequency, to activate genetic gifts dormant within my extraterrestrial DNA for the collective. There are much more awakening souls on our planet, or so it seems, than the quantity presented - could it be in reference to anything else?

![nadis.jpg](/img/user/images/nadis.jpg)

The Tantras speak of Nadis, channels for the flow of consciousness. Nadi (नाड़ी) means flow, river, tube, or pathway. There are said to be 36,000 on each side of the body, both positive and negative, totaling 72,000. These nadis are believed to be pathways through which Prana (life force energy) flows. In the same way that electricity flows through wires, the vital force (prana shakti), mind force (manas shakti) and kundalini energy (mahaprana) flow through the nadis. Blockages in Nadis are created through the accumulation of toxins, negative thoughts/energies, disease, and negative samskaras(karma). There are three main nadis. Ida is considered the passive, feminine, yin energy channel, which controls the mental processes. Pingala is the active, masculine, yang energy channel, which controls the vital processes. Sushumna is the central, neutral energy channel that passes through the spine, through which the cosmic energy of spiritual awakening flows(when Ida and Pingala are balanced). When Ida and Pingala awaken at the base of the spine, they are meant to move in synergy up in a spiral motion to the central channel of the shushumna. Here they unite at the third eye center, awakening the higher spiritual organs of perception. Once the 72,000 channels have been brought into unity through the three main nadis, or so some of the New Age philosophers speaks of, they supposedly double in their power - to 144,000. An amplification, a x2 which occurs once things balance and rise, coming into union, the system flows openly. 

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 223258.png| 500](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20223258.png)

Another way we get to this number is through the petals of the chakra system. 
The root has 4 petals, the sacral 6, solar plexus has 10, the heart has 12, and the throat has 16. This equals 48. The third eye chakra is represented by 2 petals. If we take the sum of the lower 5 chakras, and multiply it by two(48x2), we get 96. If we then add this together, 96+48, we get to 144. The crown chakra, or thousand petal lotus has, well, 1,000 petals. Multiply the 144 by 1,000, and you again result back at this number - 144,000.

![144Nadis.jpg](/img/user/images/144Nadis.jpg)

People who begin to see 144 all over the place, you'd be surprised there's quite a few of them on the internet, are said to be undergoing an awakening process on the physiological level. The number 144 is supposedly reflected back to them through their universe as their body is undergoing physiological upgrades, even down to the minute level of the mitochondria. DNA is upgrading evolving and expanding, as ones consciousness is raising itself in vibration. When our consciousness is awakening, our frequency begins to rise. We are not simply exiting the mental slumber we were in separate from the body. The actual frequency of our energy body is raising itself in hertz, our spiritual-electric charge is amplifying. The subtle body becomes capable of holding more and more life-force/prana, requiring more as-well in order to maintain and stabilize the heightened, ascended state of consciousness. 

Some even theorize the 144,000 are reincarnations of the previous prophets and pious saints, all together, meeting in the end of times, once and for all, to establish the divine just state, heaven on earth.

There is one other reference to 144 in Revelations. The Apostle John beholds a breathtaking sight: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away" (Revelation 21:1). This is the renewed creation – the arrival of the Holy City. Describing it as it walks down the isle, "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (Revelation 21:2). A great voice from the throne proclaims "'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God'" (Revelation 21:3) It represents the end of sorrow and suffering, for God "'will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away'" (Revelation 21:4). 
The city doesn't need the sun or moon because "the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb Jesus Christ is its lamp" (Revelation 21:23). John observed "And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls."(Revelation 21:15)

![measuringrod.jpg](/img/user/images/measuringrod.jpg)

"The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal." (Revelation 21:16)

![12000furloughs.jpg](/img/user/images/12000furloughs.jpg)

![fifteenhundredmiles.jpg](/img/user/images/fifteenhundredmiles.jpg)

Continuing, recording its impressive dimensions... "He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel's measurement. The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, like clear glass." (Revelation 21:17-18)

The precious gemstone **Jasper** paired with the number **144** also show up in a completely different context - the world of Marvel. Comic book history is often divided into distinct periods; the Golden Age came first, then the Silver Age (roughly spanning the late 1950s to the early 1970s), followed by the Bronze and Modern Ages. The series _Strange Tales_, featuring Doctor Strange and Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., reached issue number **144** in May 1966, right in the heart of the Silver(47) Age. Within the pages of _Strange Tales_ #144, amidst tales of espionage and mysticism, Marvel Comics introduced a brand new character in the Nick Fury story: Agent _Jasper_ Sitwell.

The Octahedron, representing the element of air has a sum of 1440∘.

In esoteric practices, Air fundamentally symbolizes the power of the mind, intellect, rational thought, communication, and the vital breath of life. The Air Element is the fourth Chakra, the heart center, Anahata.  The higher emotions of the Heart are expressive of unconditional love, thus the Air Element acts as a medium of expression for the Spirit Element above, which channels these
higher love energies. "Ruach HaKodesh" (רוח הקודש) is the Hebrew term for "Holy Spirit". It literally translates to "wind of holiness" or "spirit of holiness".

According to the Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, the 47th name of the 72 Shem HaMephorash angels is Ayin Shin Lamed. The meaning, at least from some modern sources - Global transformation begins in your own heart.

Guardian angel, Asaliah – _“God Who Reveals the Truth”_

_“You say you want a revolution, well, you know, we all want to change the world.”_
—John Lennon & Paul McCartney

This is closely related to the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam, which states that if you want to repair the world, you need to _start_ with _yourself_. This is called Tikkun Ha-Lev (Repairing the Heart).

![Screenshot 2025-04-06 222945.png](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20222945.png)

Shabbetai Zevi was born in the city of Smyrna, where he grew up and received a sound grounding in the Talmud. He was ordained as a Rabbi at the early age of 18. Later he steeped himself in the mystical writings of the Kabbala. Shabbetai was born on 9th of Av, the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple but also, according to tradition, the day on which the coming Messiah will be born. At 22, Shabbetai declared himself to be that very individual. 

The news spread rapidly throughout the Jewish world. There was even talk of Shabbetai assembling a Jewish army to reconquer the Holy Land. Jewish communities everywhere were being captivated by these events, giving many their first real taste of religious enthusiasm. The year 1666 is particularly significant in Jewish history due to the events surrounding Shabbatai Zevi, and in February of that year he was imprisoned by the head of the Ottoman state. At the height of his messianic influence, he was forced to make a decision. Facing charges of sedition, he had to either convert to Islam, or be killed. Shabbatai converted, ensuring his life, and letting down the world of Judaism. He was proclaimed the false messiah, and all the hype which he had built, was a let-down. Sabbatai is perhaps most responsible for what the world of modern Judaism has shaped itself into. He is the reason that they began to put restrictions on the who can learn Kabbala, mainly that you had to be 40 years old, and with a life that can ground your spiritual ventures.

Sabbatai Zevi interpreted "Tikkun Olam" (repairing the world) through a radical lens, believing that during the Messianic Age, even acts traditionally considered sinful could become righteous. Nathan of Gaza, Sabbatais messianic spokesperson and cheerleader, came up with a unique philosophy to account for his conversion. He argued that the Messiah's mission required a descent into the realm of the _Qlippoth_ (the "husks" or "shells" representing evil and impurity in Lurianic Kabbalah) It was necessary to battle the forces of darkness from within to liberate the trapped sparks of divine light. Descent was seen as a paradoxical, necessary part of the _Tikkun_ (rectification) process. His task involves confronting, entering, even almost becoming - before ultimately subduing or rectifying, the Qlippothic forces. These were often symbolized by the Dragon/Serpent.

![Pasted image 20250419060536.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250419060536.png)

In Hebrew, Sabbatai means Saturn. In Jewish tradition, "the reign of Sabbatai," the highest planet, was often linked to the advent of the Messiah. 

"Sabbatai Zevi himself was much taken by gematria- in fact, much of his energy following his declaration of his messiahship was spent on discovering gematriot that would prove his messiahship or indicate his spiritual perfection. For example, he discovered in 1665 that the gematria of his name, Sabbatai Zevi, was identical to that of the phrase “the true messiah”

Nero Caesar, the emperor of Rome from 54-68 AD, was often equated with the antichrist. Nero’s hatred of religion and superstition was written about by Suetonius. In addition, we know that Nero was disliked by the Jews, as it was under his reign the the Jewish Revolt of 66-73 AD began. He initiated the first state-sponsored persecution of Christians in Rome, likely beginning around 64 AD, following the Great Fire of Rome. In the journal of Tacitus it was said that he blamed Christians for the fire and used them as scapegoats, leading to brutal executions. When you take his name and translate it into Hebrew, you get נרון קסר .

![neroncaesar.jpg](/img/user/images/neroncaesar.jpg)

The gematria system did not have much prevalence at the time of his rule, but even so, during his time he was viewed as a wicked man. Some argued that the Book of Revelation intends Nero as the antichrist figure. 

In 41 AD, Seneca was exiled to the island of Corsica. He was allowed to return in 49 AD to become a tutor for the next in line, Nero. Five years later, when he became emperor in 54AD, Seneca became Nero's advisor. Together with Sextus Afranius Burrus, appointed praetorian prefect, the two essentially acted as the government for the first five years of Nero's reign. After Burrus's death in 62AD, Seneca's influence declined quite fast. Tacitus wrote in his book _The Annals_, "the death of Burrus broke Seneca's power." He tried to retire twice, once in 62AD, and again in 64AD, but Nero refused. Even then he was not as present in court. In 65AD Seneca was thought to be a part of a conspiracy to kill Nero, and forced to commit suicide. It is likely that he was innocent, but, nevertheless, he agreed to end himself in a calm stoic manner.
