# DopenessOnDeck47

It all began with a dream.
DopenessOnDeck47
It came to me
Out of the woodworks
an alternate persona
at work washing dishes
serving sandwiches
I discovered my purpose
I was going to create a YouTube channel

The idea was to cross breed the consciousness of JollieOllie420 with someone like Tony Robbins and the kid that bends spoons in the matrix. Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High with Steven Hawking, Guy Fieri and Eckhart Tolle. At first you would think - this man has been to too many raves, he sounds absolutely ridiculous - but eventually, somehow, someway, it would become evident that he has broken through to an absolutely profound understanding of reality. Sounds so dumb, his brain is absolutely fried off its gord, but the content of what he is speaking about is opening my mind up to think in ways which it has not before. He embodies a consciousness which I have never seen before. It's like a self directed Mk Ultra project. It's as though in the process of frying his brain, another part of it had evolved and transformed - what could perhaps be the evolution of man. This brave young veteran has gone to learn from the depths of God face to face and is a living wizard whom verbalizes speech in the form of dimethyltryptamine hits to the pineal with each consonant embodying reality shattering wisdom. 

This is what DopenessOnDeck47 was going to be. Ultimately an individual attempting to share advanced spiritual concepts under a hidden identity of stoner cheech and chong man. Maybe he somehow is able to figure out how to save the world and evolve mankind. Maybe he's just able to make enough money to make it out of his Dad's basement. 

"Yo whats going on guys dopenessondeck here, 47,  whats up
today I wanted to talk to you guys about astrological time travel exploration through fifth dimensional time hopping strategies 
maybe release our sins and cleanse ourselves of all karma liberating ourselves
from the punishments accumulated over all lifetimes forever 
we're going to visit the palace of unlimited swagger 
just chill for a moment, catch our breath - holding it for 5 seconds to begin to enter the parasympathetic nervous system - we let in the feeling of safety, of chillness 
Now with this heightened vibrational frequency we're going to navigate our consciousness
to go ahead and release a prayer for the liberation of all beings
may all find that feeling of legitness deep inside themselves
this is a vibe of incredibly potent divine energy..."

Soon I began to see the number everywhere. 
I had just pulled it out completely randomly.
And then it painted my world. 

I became obsessed.
Started looking into it.
Saw that other people were obsessed as-well.
Alright this is weird.

I had all sorts of strange things begin to occur.
I thought I saw a UFO.

Eventually I got myself into a kundalini yoga teacher training. 
After it was over, I found a deeper layer to the number than I 
could have ever guessed possible. 

Here is a summary of all that I could find.

# Capital Steeze

![Screenshot 2025-02-28 034819.png](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-02-28%20034819.png)

In middle school I was a huge fan of rap music. Joey Badass was one of my favorites. I also played a lot of Call of Duty, and the people that were making montages - for aesthetically complex trick-shots and phenomenally impressive quad feeds - often synced their edits to music from the label he was in, Pro Era. I liked most of the artists I came across, but Joey Badass and Capital Steeze had to be 2 of my favorites from that scene(along with The Underachievers). 1999(ft. Steeze), Joeys debut mixtape, specifically, was something that I was bumping nonstop as a young suburban 13 year old. 

Little did I know anything of Capital Steeze's obsession with the number 47, or the fact that I was soon to follow in his footsteps down a rabbit hole I may never find my way out of. Unfortunately it seems he never did, tragically committing suicide at the age of 19, jumping off his record labels building in New York, on the date 12/23/12 - which adds up perfectly to 47. 

Steeze's connection to 47 extended beyond simple interest, it was a core component of his spiritual belief system and promulgated who he was as an artist. He viewed this number as the "perfect expression of balance in the world," representing the tension between the heart and mind, emotion and intellect, thought and feeling - the 4th and 7th chakras. The 4th chakra, Anahata, representing the heart, and the 7th chakra, Sahisrara, representing the crown. 47 was the number that represented the perfect balance between the two. Some fans even connect the 47 to the Egyptian Ankh, which represents the balance between feminine and masculine energy, thev heart chakra representing the feminine and the crown the masculine.

Steeze viewed himself as an indigo(put onto the idea by Issa of The Underachievers), "a being of higher dimensional consciousness." This played heavily into the music and image that he created. It gave a foundation for his obsession with the number to flourish. His perception of himself as a multidimensional being hints to us that he could have perhaps viewed the number as a key to understanding the nature of reality itself, being a guiding force for the unfoldment of his spiritual journey. 

The most visible manifestation of the number 47 in Steez's work appeared on the cover of his mixtape "AmeriKKKan Korruption."

![47-19-8-23-18-5-58m.jpg](/img/user/images/47-19-8-23-18-5-58m.jpg) 
The number was prominently displayed on the album artwork in a way that resembled a swastika. It is interesting to see that now our 47th president is being compared to Hitler. Steeze was a bit of a troll and thought it would be controversial to stylize the 47 in this manner, also joking about wanting to be able to make "Swastickas" stickers for the album. 



Unfortunately, the scene he was in was not built for someone of that nature. He went too deep into the spiritual side of things. Describing his memories in an interview with a therapist, Joey Badass 

"Eventually it got to a point where he would speak 
and nobody would understand
that's kind of how you knew.. like..
he was advancing, you know what I'm saying
...
I think that he thought that he was
dreaming 
...
closer to his death, you know,
there was just days where I would just 
look him in his eyes and he's looking past me
he's not looking at anything that's here
he's not looking at me
he's looking through me, like way past"

The therapist then remarked that it sounded as though Steeze had opened himself up to all of this spiritual awareness - but didn't himself have a teacher that could help him to assimilate and unpack what he was experiencing. He couldn't process it all, and being too much, he didn't know what to do - was overwhelmed - ultimately leading to his suicide. 

Joey agreed wholeheartedly.

I'm not certain that my exploration into this number would have found the propellant fuel it needed if I wasn't witness to Steeze's journey of plunging into the numbers wilderness and carving the way before me. This inspired a belief in me that I wasn't just going crazy, maybe there was something to it - so I didn't dismiss it. 

I stuck to it long enough to find what it was about.

4ever res7 in peace.

# Checker 47

![Kukuk-gold.jpg](/img/user/images/Kukuk-gold.jpg)

Checker 47 is a handsome grey Westphalian gelding, born back in 2010. 
Ridden by his equestrian Christian Kukuk, the duo has lately been taking the world by storm. 

Since its inception in 1974, the Winter Equestrian Festival has been one of the world's most prestigious horse events, spanning over 13 weeks. In March of 2024, Christian and Checker 47 were able to secure victory, winning the finale of the $500,000 Rolex CSI5* Grand Prix. 
Later in the year, the team took on the Olympics in Paris.
Christian and Checker 47, with a nearly perfect performance, took home the Individual Jumping Gold, and ended a (4x7)28-year drought plaguing their country in the event.
For "horse" country Germany, housing more horses than any other country in Europe, and having a reputation for their production of top-quality horses and riders, this was a big win. 
Just recently, in January of 2025, they also won the $215,000 NetJets CSI4 Grand Prix.*
Checker 47 is the highest earning horse over the last 2 years, having amassed an eye-watering total of nearly $3 million in career prize money, a majority of that coming in from their recent and legendary tournament tear.

"Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse...
.... He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood"

# Whale Whale Whale....

![HHT4COIYDBHJHCNFNFISEL3O34.kpg.jpg](/img/user/images/HHT4COIYDBHJHCNFNFISEL3O34.kpg.jpg)

Less than 6 months ago, a dead fin whale measuring approximately 47 feet long washed ashore tidal flats near Anchorage, Alaska. Fin whales are the second largest whale and are seen quite rarely, found on the endangered list. This odd event magnetically drew in hundreds of visitors and shortly found itself becoming a citywide phenomenon. Based on its length, the fin whale is estimated to be quite young, likely less than 2 years old(what a toddler). Adult fin whales can get up to around 70-80 feet. They still do not know what caused its death, but if all goes as planned, the skeleton which supported its oceanic journeys will have a permanent home in the Wasilla museum.

I could have sworn I had already seen this article at some point... but that was a few years ago, wasn't it? Right when the number thing was first happening... I remember thinking that the 47 was interesting of course, but it wasn't much of a big deal .... there are a lot of whales out there washing up with all sorts of lengths....

![fwc-sperm-whale-florida-keys.jpg](/img/user/images/fwc-sperm-whale-florida-keys.jpg)

In the shallows of Key West Florida, in May of 2022, was found a once majestic 47-foot sperm whale who swam through the waters with grace, being feasted upon by a whole host of sharks, dead. The whale “had a mass of intertwined line, net pieces and a plastic bag-type material in its stomach. This debris likely did not allow the whale to eat properly, leading to its emaciated condition and stranding.” Sperm whale strandings are relatively rare, they are on the endangered list and experts note that they are more accustomed to deep water. This is where they can dive miles into the Ocean and find their favorite snack - squid. This species is the largest of the toothed whales, and there are only about 300,000 of them left today. 

It turns out there was another 47 foot sperm whale that found its way onto shores for a pre-emptive death. Adult sperm 'shipwrecks' are quite rare in Massachusetts waters, they are rarely even seen, and if so, it's often younger calves. Only two large adult males have stranded on Nantucket in the past 3 decades: one in 1997 and another in 2002.  The first was a 47-foot animal that stranded alive on Low Beach, Siasconset, on Dec. 30, 1997, whose skeleton is now on display in the Nantucket Whaling Museum. The second was a 46-foot, 45-ton whale that washed up on June 7, 2002, at Great Point. I am inclined to believe that somebody out there has made a drastic measurement error, but the skeleton of this animal is on display in the New Bedford Whaling Museum.

    causing their fish to die."

# Pomona College

![pomona-college-47.jpg](/img/user/images/pomona-college-47.jpg)

Pomona College, a prestigious liberal arts institution in Claremont, California, is home to a unique tradition centered around the number 47. Located off Interstate 10's exit 47, the college became the birthplace of what would later be known as "The 47 Society." This tradition began in 1964 when students Laurie Mets and Bruce Elgin conducted a research project exploring whether the number 47 appeared more frequently in nature than expected by chance. Soon students began to see 47 often. They termed it the quintessential random number. Their findings, coupled with a humorous mathematical proof created going back and forth with professor Donald Bentley, claiming that 47 was equal to Pi, even later being argued to equal all numbers, became a meme among students, and a tradition in his class from that point on, along with proceeding professors in later decades. Over time, the number became ingrained in Pomona's culture, with numerous "47 sightings" documented across campus. One of such is in Mudd-Blaisdell (formally Florence Carrier Blaisdell and Della Mullock Mudd Hall, a title with 47 characters), which contains the largest dormitory's staircase at 47 balusters, finishing in its construction in 1947. Another is that there are 47 pipes around the top row of Lyman Hall Organ in the Thatcher Music Building. The Smith Memorial Tower, in the early 2010's, was set to chime on the 47th minute of the hour. The tradition has even extended beyond campus, leaking into the world through alumni contributions. 

The most famous of these is from Joe Menosky incorporating references to 47 in _Star Trek_ episodes. Today, Pomona celebrates this quirky tradition annually on April 7 (4/7)
# Star-Trek

Writer and producer Joe Menosky, an alumni of Pomona College, brought the 47 tradition with him when he joined the writing staff of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). Menosky started embedding the number 47 into scripts and other screen details. Writers and production staff members caught on and embraced the easter egg, ensuring its continued appearance even in episodes Menosky wasn't directly involved with.

It has appeared in numerous ways across TNG, _Deep Space Nine_, _Voyager_, _Enterprise_, and even newer series like Discovery and Picard. You might spot it:

- On computer console displays (LCARS readouts)
- As part of stardates
- In quantities mentioned in dialogue ("There are 47 survivors," "Frequency 47," "Section 47")
- On star charts or technical schematics
- As part of ship registry numbers or designations (though less common)
- Even subtly hidden in set design elements.

It became a fun tradition for fans to spot the "47" in episodes, and perhaps drove a few others mad wondering as to what its significance may be.

![GZaoVaBasAQt--7.jpeg](/img/user/images/GZaoVaBasAQt--7.jpeg)

On October 8th 2024, the Los Angeles Dodgers played in a quarter finals match against the San Diego Padres in their home stadium. The sell out crowd filling the Padres Petco Park stadium broke a new record for attendees, touching 47,774 people in total.

The Dodgers then went on to win the World Series in its entirety.
The MLB playoff payout, luckily for them, had hit a record $129 million.
This left them each with $477,740.70
Not much for someone like Shohei Ohtani, the highest paid MLB player,
whom they have on a 10 year contract for $700,000,000 -
but it may be a handsome payday for players getting paid
the MLB's minimum salary, which during 2024, was $740,000.

Jackie Robinson was the first to cross the Major League Baseball's color barrier on April 15, 1947. This made him the first African American to play professionally when he took the field playing first base for the _Dodgers_ (although notably they were located in Brooklyn at the time). A ticket to that game, in 2022, sold for a whopping $480,000

![41YCQo56mgL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg](/img/user/images/41YCQo56mgL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg)

Jackie Robinson's number was 42. According to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, 42 is "the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything." For a number heralded as so important, it really is quite close to 47.  

When Star Trek producer and screenwriter Rick Berman had been asked by curious fans about the significance of the number 47 appearing all over the place within the franchise. He once joked, "47 is 42, corrected for inflation," in reference.

On June 5th 1947 Secretary of State George Marshall proposed the Marshall plan in a speech delivered to 15,000 people at Harvard University, a US initiative to help rebuild war-torn Western Europe after WW2. Providing financial relief to help rebuild the economies of 17 countries (todays equivalent of $133 billion) and prevent the spread of communism, being touted as “one of the greatest of America's foreign policy successes,” contributing to a "golden age" of economic growth and prosperity in Europe.

 “Churchill’s words won the war, Marshall’s words won the peace.”
	– Dirk Stikker, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1948-1952

In 1947 the USSR developed its own economic recovery program, 
in response to the Marshall Plan, 
refusing the aid which was allocated to them,  
known as the Molotov Plan 🔥💥🍾

![HUMANRIGHTSCOUNCIL.jpg](/img/user/images/HUMANRIGHTSCOUNCIL.jpg)

The Human Rights Council is an intergovernmental body within the United Nations system made up of 47 States. They are responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe. On 4-7-2022, the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting and voted to suspend Russia's membership rights in the Human Rights Council. They did this because of a "grave concern regarding the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly regarding reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation." Shortly after the vote, Russia announced it was withdrawing from the council altogether before the suspension formally took effect. The Czech Republic was elected by the General Assembly in May 2022 to fill that vacant seat, restoring the balance back to 47.

The Boeing B-47, the world’s first swept-wing bomber, made its initial flight on Dec. 17, 1947.
It was revolutionary and set the pattern for multi-engine jet aircraft, having a powerful influence on everything that came afterwards. The B-47 was the first to incorporate many advanced features for its time, and was the fastest bomber of the world in the late 1940s. Built to intimidate Russia with the threat of nukes... just in case. Their range, speed, and payload posed the significant threat of optimal explosive delivery and worked as a significant deterrent to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The B-47 often took on a second function as a modified reconnaissance aircraft, used for gathering strategic intelligence, flying over the Soviet Union and its allies to collect photographic and electronic intelligence data. A modified version of the aerial vehicle was later designed for this specific purpose, the reconnaissance version, called the RB-47.

![F-47-artist-rendition_(cropped).jpg](/img/user/images/F-47-artist-rendition_(cropped).jpg)

Donald Trump has recently announced that the United States Government has signed a contract with Boeing to put into production the new F-47, supposedly the "most lethal aircraft ever built."

The number 47 was chosen by the US Air Force because "it honors the legacy of the P-47, whose contributions to air superiority during World War II remain historic. Additionally, the number pays tribute to the founding year of the Air Force, while also recognizing the 47th President's pivotal support for the development of the world's first sixth-generation fighter."

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was a heavily armed and exceptionally tough American fighter flown during World War II. Its versatility allowed it to serve effectively as both an escort fighter and later as a devastating ground-attack platform, perhaps the most effective of the conflict. Being one of the most produced Allied fighters, it contributed significantly to their air superiority and ground support operations.

Referring to the up and coming F-47, Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, “We’re going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.”

The engineering and manufacturing development contract, worth more than $20 billion, would be awarded to Boeing. 

Of course, you've heard of their famous and historic Boeing 747, dubbed the 'Queen of the Skies.'
They've also got the Boeing 777, often called the "Triple Seven,"

And of course, yes, the United States Air Force became a separate military service with the implementation of the National Security Act.... in 1947.


![photo_1_banner.jpg](/img/user/images/photo_1_banner.jpg)

On the 18th of September 1947 The National Security Act mandated a major reorganization of the foreign policy and military establishments of the U.S. Government.

Along with the United States Air Force (USAF), this act was responsible for the creation of the Department of Defense(DoD), the National Security Council(NSC), and of course, the infamous Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 🕵️🥸

On June 24, 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed that he saw a string of nine shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour.  This was the first post-World War II sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings. This is the man that invented the term "flying saucer."
	Mt Reinier sits at ~46.8523° N - placing this event, essentially, on the 47th parallel.

Of course, we have Donald Trump as the new 47th president of the United States.
This comes along with his Agenda 47, the campaign manifesto that details policies sought to be implemented upon his election. 
His cult following has attempted to take over the number, 
but we will persist in making sure its beauty is not lost. 
All publicity is wonderful.
As you can see, the collective is beginning to prime the subconscious minds of its people in what will eventually be a beautiful widespread gnosis of the number 47.

Elon Musk's Self-driving Model Y SUV came out in 2020 at $47,000.

Elon Musk, through his PAC "Elon's America," launched an initiative offering $47 to registered voters who refer others to sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. This was done in key swing states with an aim to gather one million signatures before the upcoming presidential election. There was a lot of controversy surrounding this, but the initiative is legally permissible as it incentivizes petition referrals, not voter registration or voting itself. 

 The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with help from Senior Advisor Elon Musk(appointed by President Trump), said that it found $4.7 trillion in untraceable Treasury payments that were missing a critical tracking code.

![common-sense-gettyimages-544279022-2.jpg](/img/user/images/common-sense-gettyimages-544279022-2.jpg)

Common Sense is a 47-page pamphlet that was written by Thomas Paine in 1775–1776. It advocated towards the people of the Thirteen Colonies a drive towards independence from Great Britain, and the creation of a democratic republic. It is widely considered to have been a significant influence on the Declaration of Independence.

Harvey J. Kaye, author of Thomas Paine and the Promise of America, claims that "most Americans thought _Common Sense_ was the revolutionary document, not the Declaration of Independence,"

 John Adams wrote to his wife in 4-1776, "Common Sense, like a ray of revelation, has come in seasonably to clear our doubts, and to fix our choice."

Some call Thomas "the forgotten founder." He hasn't received as much recognition as other important figures in the Revolution, not even able to secure a statue of himself in the nation's capital. Only 6 people attended Mr. Paine's funeral.

	"The draft of the Declaration was revised first by Adams and Franklin, and then by the full committee. A total of 47 alterations, including the insertion of three complete paragraphs, were made to the text before it was presented to Congress on June 28."

The 12-by-18-foot oil-on-canvas painting by the American artist John Trumbull, created in 1818, depicts the presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress, and 47 individuals.

The earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence is a fragment known as the "Composition Draft". Written in July of 1776, the fragment had been preserved unrecognized in the Library of Congress, that is, until historian Julian P. Boyd reexamined primary documents for his publication in _The Papers of Thomas Jefferson_. The fragment had been mistakenly filed under a September 1777 date(whoops). Heavily edited in Jefferson's clear, precise handwriting, it ended up proving itself to be a key component in unraveling the story of the writing of the Declaration. It turns out that the "Rough Draft" which was thought to be the first edition, was not - this fragment making itself clear as the elder parchment. 

"The Fragment contains several words and passages that are crossed out; none of these was copied into the 'Rough draught' (or true fair copy),"
	-Boyd (in his first volume of _The Papers of Thomas Jefferson_)

Historians had argued that a heavily edited draft must have preceded the copy Jefferson had endorsed as the original rough draft, and now they finally had proof.

When did this discovery occur? 
1947

On June 11th, a committee was appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, consisting of John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman. According to John Adams' 1805 Autobiography, this committee first decided on the Declaration's core content and then formed a subcommittee with Jefferson and Adams to handle the actual writing.

Thomas Jefferson, however, disputed this claim, and in his own letter written in 1823 confronts what seems to be a false claim from John Adams. 

"Mr. Adams memory has led him into unquestionable error. At the age of 88 and 47 years after the transactions, . . . this is not wonderful. Nor should I . . . venture to oppose my memory to his, were it not supported by written notes, taken by myself at the moment and on the spot. . . The Committee of 5 met, no such thing as a sub-committee was proposed, but they unanimously pressed on myself alone to undertake the draught. I consented; I drew it; but before I reported it to the committee I communicated it separately to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams requesting their corrections;. . . and you have seen the original paper now in my hands, with the corrections of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams interlined in their own handwriting. Their alterations were two or three only, and merely verbal. I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the committee, and from them, unaltered to the Congress."

By the early 1820s the original Declaration of Independence, an engrossed parchment document, was already showing significant signs of aging and fading. Concerns grew about its preservation and the need for an exact replica(for posterity purposes). In 1820, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, recognizing the deterioration, commissioned William J. Stone, a prominent Washington D.C. engraver, to create a full-size, exact facsimile of the original Declaration. Stone completed the copperplate in 1823 (**47** years after 1776).

# National Treasure 2 

![National-Treasure-page-47.jpg](/img/user/images/National-Treasure-page-47.jpg)

National Treasure 2, a heavily masonic themed movie, features the number with great emphasis.
The movie begins with Nicholas Cage's character, Ben Gates, teaching at a convention. In the midst of his lecture, he is interrupted by an audience member that holds the remnants of an old journal - ultimately changing the story. Supposedly held onto by his family, his ancestry descending from the infamous mason Albert Pike, a black-market treasure dealer has found what is a missing page of the diary of John Wilkes Booth. This piece of paper not only contained secret clues to the location of a lost city of gold(which ends up being in the heads of Mount Rushmore), but it also linked Ben's ancestor Thomas Gates as an accomplice to Booth in what was Lincoln's assassination. Ben determines to solve the puzzle and find the city of gold before this mysterious man, as-well as to set the history straight and restore his families legacy

Eventually we find ourselves in a dramatic moment. Ben Gates has discovered the first part of the map leading to the city of gold. To obtain the other, he must find the second half of an ancient plank of wood coded with inscriptions. No longer hidden in the compartment it was originally stored inside of within the presidential desk(he looked), all they were left with was a symbol etched in its place. 

But the journey wasn't over.

Nicholas Cage sits on the big-screen and reveals the only path forward, "I am going to kidnap the President of the United States." 

You see the symbol was legendary, supposedly representative of a secret shared diary, one written by presidents, for presidents. We're not just talking the assassination of JFK. The 18 1/2 missing minutes of the Watergate tapes. Did the Apollo really land on the moon? What about Area 51... Gates was not sure if it was real or not, that is, until he saw it for himself in the oval office. A legendary confidential notebook, a collection of documents passed down to each U.S. President as they come into their term, containing secrets too dangerous or shocking to reveal to the general public. This is where the second half of the map was to be located.

Only the current president knows where this esoteric literature is kept, each one chooses their own designated hiding place. Ben Gates would only need a few minutes with him... 

The team influences the location which the White House decides to hold the Presidents birthday at, making sure it takes place at Mount Vernon. Here Nicholas Cage lures the president into a secret tunnel, chocked up as a history lesson, closing the doors behind themselves as he reveals his true intentions. Making a plea to the President to provide for him the location of the book, Ben Gates doesn't have much time as the secret service is on their tail.

At first the President denies its existence. Eventually, Nicholas's Cages captivating charisma breaks him down and The Head of State begins to spill the beans. Revealing the hidden coordinates of its location to be in the the library of congress, the treasure hunter is eager to make his way forward. If he isn't successful and does not find the city of gold, changing the course of American history, he will be charged with kidnapping the President...

But before he can go, the President stops him. 
"I want you to do something for me...
	
	"It would be a priveledge, sir"

"Page 47. Just have a look at that"

Thomas Gates goes on and finds the book, the city of gold, and accomplishes all that he set out to do.

Nation Treasure 2 ends with a cliffhanger.
In the epilogue of the film, the President and Gates rub shoulders again.

The President commends Ben for his service to the country and thanks him, before revealing the headline of the next day's newspaper which will ultimately clear his ancestor Thomas Gate's from any involvement in the assassination of Lincoln. He is also cleared of charges for kidnapping the President.

Mission accomplished. 

But before the movie ends.

The President asks,

"I mean, I am curious about that favor I asked you.
Any report regarding what's on page 47?"

*staring into his soul not blinking a single time during the 8 second delivery as his head turns slightly while ominous background music rises in the background

"I believe I can help with that sir"

"So it's good?"

*the camera zooms in on Nicholas Cage's face as they continue to make intense eye contact

"Life altering sir"

The president nods Nicholas Cage to join him as they walk away - they seem to be in an airplane hangar, perhaps to a plane, to discuss the matter more

The sidekick which joined Ben Gates along his journey, cries out 

"What's on page 47? Are you talking about the book?"

The president turns back 

"What book?"

There are many thoughts as to what the page's contents could be, it was heavily theorized to be the premise for National Treasure 3 if it were to ever go into development. Unfortunately it seems that National Treasure 3 will never come into the light of day, having been buried by Disney, but they did release a short series on Disney Plus in 2022. 

In it they threw a nod towards the number

What is on Page 47? 
We may never know.

# Freemasonry

![3061.jpg](/img/user/images/3061.jpg)

Euclid's 47th problem, also known as Proposition 47 in Euclid's Elements, is the Pythagorean theorem: in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. It holds profound symbolic and practical significance in Freemasonry, intertwining mathematical truth with philosophical ideals. Represented by three squares forming a 3:4:5 right triangle, this geometric principle (a2+b2=c2) demonstrates how to "square a square,"  symbolic for restoring balance and order. Its mathematical certainty reflects the immutability of moral and natural laws. The fact that it exists mean there is structure to the universe. It is the root of all geometry. It is behind the discovery of every mathematical unknown from two known factors. It is the very cornerstone of mathematics. 

Though attributed to Euclid, the theorem’s roots trace to Pythagoras, whose work influenced early Masonic reverence for geometry as a divine science. Numbers were the most divine thing to the Pythagoreans.

"All is number"
	-Pythagoras

Pythagoreans were famous for their teachings, but also their secrecy.
Once someone became a Pythagorean, there were less and less questions, fewer answers, and more riddles - much like the world of masonry. 

The word "geometry" originates from the Ancient Greek word "geōmetria,"
Gē=Earth, land
metria/metron=a measuring of

Through the use of geometry, one can trace nature, following her to discover the power, wisdom and goodness that operates under our nose as the universal principles orchestrating our reality. 
By picking up on the laws of our world one can view with delight the magnificence with which this vast machine governs itself and maintains order. Through geometry, we trace the movements of the planets in their respective orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions; through geometry, we account for the change of the seasons, and the variety of scenes which each season displays. It is an observation of God's beautiful proportions, and the masons take on the task to observe the perfect symmetry of this divine artist in order to emulate and take on some of its attributes inside of their own life. The 47th Problem of Euclid inspires Masons to be great lovers of the Arts and Sciences.

Ultimately, the 47th problem was not even a discovery of Pythagoras. 
The earliest proof of the mathematical ratio comes from Babylonia on clay tablets dated to
around 1800 BC. We also have Egyptian papyri from around the same time which has a mathematical problem, whose solution is a Pythagorean triple of 6 8 and 10, and clearly displays a
triangle. Not only in those places, but also in India, between the 8th and fifth centuries BC, we have sutras which contain lists of Pythagorean triples and even a statement of the Pythagorean theorem.

The first reference to the 47th Problem of Euclid or Pythagoras in a masonic context was in Dr James Anderson's constitution, published in 1723, considered to be one of the most important works in the history of the Freemasonry. In it he states “The Greater Pythagoras, provided the Author of the 47th Proposition of Euclid’s first Book, which, if duly observed, is the Foundation of all Masonry, sacred, civil, and military…”

Within the Masonic lodge itself, this symbolism finds resonance. The numbers three, four, and five are built into the lodge's structure and officers, the points of entrance, and the very arrangement of the three burning tapers around the altar, which can symbolically form this right triangle. It exists all over the place in their symbology.

The 3-4-5 triangle is the simplest demonstration of the theorem.

"El Shaddai" (אל שדי)
	God Almighty
		Whenever this name appears in the Torah, it is usually in the context of God showering one of His faithful with abundant blessings. Some interpretations suggest it might also relate to the Hebrew word for "breasts," therefore meaning something along the lines of "God, the breasted one," "_the God of many breasts_" or "the mighty-breasted God." 🤘

"B'shagam" (בְּשָׁגָם) 
	 "for he is also flesh"
		The rest of verse Genesis 6:3 ends with,  "yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."
			Although not explicitly referencing the man, this is seen by Rabbis to be the first  esoteric introduction to Moses, who's ship sailed at that age, especially given the matching 345 gematria. We know this because people continued to live past 120 for centuries after that statement in Genesis, so it could not have referred to everyone in general.

Why was Moses’ life capped at 120? What was his fatal flaw?

In the ancient text _Sefer HaPeliyah_, it reminds us that this occurred because God tells Moses to speak to a rock, promising to make water flow in the desert again. However, Moses strikes the rock instead of speaking to it. Because of just this one thing, God tells Moses that he will no longer be permitted to bring the people into the Promised Land.

_Rabbi Isaac Luria_ (1534-1572), foundational Kabbalistic figure, universally known as the Arizal, brought this to an even deeper level. He claimed that Moses’ name is 345 because he contained 345 spiritual sparks. Of these 345 sparks, they split into two directions. 

The first 37, from Abel (הבל), viewed by the Arizal as the reincarnation of Moses, with gematria value of 37.

	Yoshitoshi Tsukioka (Taiso) 1839-1892
		Part of the Seichu Gishi Meimei Den series, capturing the Chushingura (47 Ronin)

The story of the 47 Ronin, also known as the Akō incident/vendetta, is one of Japan's most iconic tales. It revolves around a group of samurai who became rōnin (masterless warriors) after their lord, Asano Naganori, was forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) for attacking a court official, Kira Yoshinaka, in retaliation of an insult. Stripped of their status and bound by the samurai code of _bushidō_, the 47 Ronin swore to avenge their master's death. Over the course of nearly two years, they meticulously planned their attack, ultimately infiltrating Kira's mansion on a snowy night in January 1703. They killed Kira and carried his severed head to Asano's grave as proof of their loyalty and justice. Rather than fleeing, they surrendered to authorities and were sentenced to commit _seppuku_, dying with honor. Their actions have since been immortalized in Japanese culture as a symbol of the unwavering samurai spirit

The movie version of _47 Ronin_ includes a protagonist Keanu Reeves, whom grows up raised by Tengu, spirit demons, who taught him their fighting ways after he was abandoned by his mother. He grows up to leave them and abandon his special dark powers. Later in the film Keanu Reeves's character, now enlisted to help the ronin, leads them back to the place of his origins, where he and the samurai must go to get their hands on the mystical swords of the Tengu, imbued with power that will help them avenge Lord Asano. Engaging in tests of will to prove their worthiness, Keanu fighting a shapeshifting lizard man, they are able to face all odds and obtain their weapons. This reminds me of what Nathan of Gaza describes in his Zohar analysis - the Treatise of the Dragon, in the descent to the Qlippoth.

At the end of the movie, there is another potential Kabbalistic link to be seen. The outcasted warrior Kai (Keanu Reeves) is forced into a deadly duel with the emperors best warrior, the Samurai _Golem_(played by actor Neil Fingleton who stands at 7'7). Golems were these huge Frankenstein type dudes who were sometimes created by Rabbis out of clay and magical words to protect villages and whatnot... maybe that's where Minecraft got it....

Keanu Reeves later goes on to, in a similarly themed movie series, become known as the legendary warrior-assassin John Wick. For anyone that has watched those films, you'd know, John Wick is nobody to fuck around with. However, there's one man out there that could probably take on the boogeyman, the unanimously feared "Baba Yaga" who was set on a trail of vengeance and violence after being left dogless....

Agent 47 is the central character of the _Hitman_ franchise, a series of stealth-based video games developed by IO Interactive. He is a genetically-engineered assassin, the 47th clone created from the DNA of five notorious criminals, designed to be the perfect killer. This was done in the hopes of creating an army full of obedient soldiers to carry out their commands. As one of the last clones to be created, 47 has his skills quite refined, and manages to escape his creators. Known for the barcode tattoo on the back of his head and his signature black suit with a red tie, Agent 47 works for the International Contract Agency (ICA), carrying out high-profile assassinations with precision and stealth. Beyond its gaming success, Hitman expanded into two film adaptations (Hitman in 2007 and Hitman: Agent 47 in 2015), as well as a series of comics and two novels.

# Writing

![Ficino,_Pimander.jpg](/img/user/images/Ficino,_Pimander.jpg)

The Corpus Hermeticum was translated into latin and published by Marsilio Ficino in 1471 for the first time. This was a pivotal moment in the Renaissance as it introduced these ancient texts, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, to a wider audience. Influencing the thought and culture of the time, this translation made significant contributions to the study and revival of Alchemy and Magic. Ficino's translation, along with his preface outlining Hermes Trismegistus's life and writings, is considered the starting point of what became known as the Hermetic tradition - and could even be seen as the seed which birthed Western Esotericism. The task was so important that he was pulled off his work on translating Plato's dialogues to work on the Corpus Hermeticum first, although his identity remained primarily as a Platonist. 

Ficino's most important philosophical work was his magnum opus - Theologia Platonica de immortalitate animae (Platonic Theology, On the Immortality of the Soul). The book was finished in 1474, but did not find its way into print until 1482. Considered by many modern scholars to be the most characteristic work of Renaissance philosophy, it was the first major system of theology in the Western tradition constructed primarily around the study of the soul. Ficino made Plato accessible, possible for the first time in centuries, and integrated Platonic thought into the cultural and intellectual fabric of his time

Who is it, then, that would be the first philosopher mage to fully identify with the work of the Hermticum? Well, it was the person who, obviously quite intrigued, translated _three additional_ Hermetic texts that were _not_ in the manuscript Ficino had worked from. The poet Lodovico Lazzarelli, born in 1447, is who we can look at as the initial individual to refer to himself as a Hermeticist, the first Hermetic philosopher in European history. His work the Crater Hermetis (The Mixing Bowl of Hermes) is also the first true work of Hermetic Philosophy in Europe. It is in this text, which was published 7 years after his death on ****uhm**** June 23, 1500, that we find the 3 additional texts which added to Ficino's 14 translations(totaling 17, sometimes 18 for those who had their hands on the Asclepius.)

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a highly infuential magical order and secret society known for their study of occultism and metaphysics, particularly Hermeticism, alchemy, Qabalah, and the magic of Hermes. They were founded in London in 1888 by William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. The Golden Dawn structured its initiatory system around the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The grades of the Outer Order corresponded to the elements and the lower Sephiroth. The fourth grade, Philosophus (4=7), is attributed to the element of Fire and the seventh Sephirah, Netzach (Victory), which is also associated with the planet Venus. In the Apocryphon of John, Sabaoth is associated with Venus, and thusly the 4=7 Ritual Grade. 

A quote I found interesting looking at this Grade's initiation procedure... 

The _Hierophant_ then leads the Practicus to the Serpent of Brass, and says:

"This is the Serpent Nehushtan, which Moses made. 'And he set it upon a Pole' --- that is, he twined it about the middle pillar of the Sephiroth, because that is the reconciler between the fires of Geburah (Seraphim, fiery serpents) or Severity, and the Waters of Chesed or Mercy. This serpent is also a type of Christ the Reconciler, also it is known as Nogah amongst the Shells, and the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom. 'But the Serpent of the Temptation was the Serpent of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and of Evil, and not the Serpent of the Tree of Life.'"

As-well, another quote, 

"Then, as before, the _Hierophant_ raises his red lamp, and cries:

"The Priestess with the Mask of Isis spake and said: 'I am the rain of Heaven descending upon the Earth, bearing with it the fructifying and germinating power. I am the plenteous yielder of Harvest; I am the cherisher of Life.'""

The Four-Seven Debate 

The Four-Seven Debate was one of the longest-running and insightful controversies in the history of Korean Confucianism. The basic problem concerned the nature and relationship between the Four Sprouts, first described by Mengzi, and the Seven Emotions, depicted in a variety of classical texts such as the _Doctrine of the Mean_. The question was: Are the Four Sprouts emotions or pure principle? If they are emotions, how can they remain as impeccable moral standards and avoid the possibility of leading one into moral error? If they are not emotions, how can they function to inspire and motivate good action and moral cultivation?
	Sounds as though they naturally picked up on many of the brain systems which Panksepp discovered in his research. Aswell, it seems that the four sprouts seem to be aspects of self which are able to control our intrinsic biological affective nature.

The Mystery of Number 47 is a 1912 comedy mystery thriller novel by the British writer J. Storer Clouston. There was later an adaptation directed in 1917, an American silent comedy thriller film.

I had a gardening co-worker named Pamela that was born in 1974. She was living with someone that was born in 1947. She was a lot of fun to get to know, and on a tour at her place of residence she began to tell my coworker and I about a story that she had where she was tripping on mushrooms sitting on a friends porch - floating around the planet Saturn - until they snapped her back to reality, waking her up from a sort of trance, appearing dissociated to them.

At the time I was powering through [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] , with a heightened awareness on the planet Saturn at the moment, as-well as the council of nine. When she began to relay this story back to me it felt as though there was certainly some sort of purpose for her in sharing this to me. I was even thinking that maybe in some way Ra / the council was trying to perhaps inspire some sort of channeling attempt with her as the instrument, myself organizing it. I wasn't certain - but I told her a little bit about the whole book series, given she was really into extraterrestrial stuff - introducing it but not going too deep. I went home and was going to send her the first part of the channeling series that they uploaded of the actual contact - and when I pulled up the YouTube video I was met with this(I didn't play the clock either.)

# aha!

Eventually there was one point, after my yoga training had come to a close, in which I was quite fed up. Around January-February of 2023. I was completely annoyed with this number having become the foothold from which my eyes peered into the world from. What is it I could have missed? This trail I have been following has felt so real, as though it were guiding my soul. Surely there must be something to this all. But alas, I know that I am fallible. I was ready to accept the fact that it was nothing that special and I was struggling with some mental health issues. I wanted to get back to my life, no longer to be driven by this neurotic search. I understood the kundalini training could have brought me to a literal kind of psychosis, in which the importance of the number heightened, that I would have to work with myself as I was. We would have to be honest and not paint over anything with pretty colors. I decided to try my hand at an MDMA solo session, in efforts to release whatever trauma was driving this unending obsession. Perhaps I just needed to feel some love, move some energy, and calm myself down. I put on some random classic romance playlist as the drug was coming up. I listened to the music and meditated as I began to feel all sorts of emotions. Eventually I found myself, at some point in this process, somewhat dissociated, all of sudden on my phone. I was staring down at the Wikipedia page for the number 47. I really cannot stop, I must mutter this number in my sleep. Well, I was going to lovingly, once and for all, see if there was anything substantial about this. Let whatever part of me that is desiring this hunt to have its fun for a moment without any judgement, maybe if I'm to let go we find something miraculous, if not, then we let him see, look, just a number, no weird feelings, lets just move forward. Next thing you know I have the idea to go down a path I hadn't before. What about the year 47? Okay, well we've got B.C. and A.D. to look at. Alright, so 47 A.D. , I look around a little bit, nothing I can see that is real special.  Then I click 47 B.C., and scroll for a second until I see a familiar date, June 23rd. My birthday. Uh oh.  "It's All Coming Back to Me" playing in the background, I sit there with my jaw dropped. I look a little further and see my father and brother having similar dates to their relatives. A part of me instantly tunes into a profound wonderous emotion of recognition, another is concerned that I have got to be under the influence of some sort of psychosis generating demonic spirit, and yet another just can't even begin to think or conceptualize any of the emotions that are being experienced. Feeling as though this is too crazy to be real... but I'm being forced to look at it directly in the face, I can't take it anymore before I have to just lay down and let Celine's magnificent voice wash over me...

Each of us has a guardian angel who accompanies us from birth to death
Born on June 23, the Kabbalistic angel which supposedly helps to guide me is the 19th angel, Leuviah. It is believed that Leuviah helps individuals access and understand memories from past lives. 

In the summer of 2022, having just begun my new gardening job, I found myself, after work, at a thrift store that one of my new co-workers had told me about. I didn't have much money at the moment, and only had maybe 5 dollars or so to spend - perhaps to my name before the next paycheck. Not sure why I even bothered to make it out there, I must have thought I was going to snipe some sort of magical synchronistic artifact through intuitive guidance or something. I'd get weird like that from time to time, feeling like I was sent into the thrift for a reason, on a mission to find the next piece of the puzzle. Shhhhhhhh I have to focus.... in deep silence we will be able to detect it... The first thing to catch my attention was this book called "The Language of the Heart" written by the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of the crazy weird dreams I formulated in my teenage years after reading Think and Grow Rich, was that I wanted to be the one to finally figure out how to end addiction once and for all. Hey, if you could truly use the law of attraction as a spiritual cheat code to 'manifest' anything, like some of these nutter-butters nudge you to believe, oh to use such powers for the Lamborghini and fame would just seem so lame. If there was anything that I had (the advantage of) specific knowledge around, and a vested emotional interest to tackle, it was the problem of addiction. If life could turn out like a genies wish maybe I could be the one to debug this thing. Alright, alright, this seems like it could be a good purchase, learning everything about the creation of one of the most famous approaches to the problem already - very on theme. But then I spotted a little statue across the way. It looked so cool, like something straight out of Greece. I had never seen anything like this at a thrift store before, it seemed like something you would see in a museum. Only $5 as-well, wow. Alright, so it has to be either this book or the little statue. The book has the potential to deepen my understanding of a topic that was quite important to me. I may have been guided to a valuable resource surrounding a crucial subject which may affect the trajectory of my life. But the statue ... I feel like you can't just pass by on something like this when you come across it. I was torn, genuinely unable to make a decision, frozen. After spending numerous minutes standing there considering my verdict, I decided that I could offload this stress to a passerby and get their opinion. I would just ask what they thought, and then go with that. The woman that I greeted and explained my deeply difficult situation to made things simple, "I'll just buy you the other one and you can get both!" I was a bit taken back at her kindness, as it was never my intention to come over and ask for charity. At first I wanted to deny her, maintain some honor, but then I just thought for a moment... what if _I could_ just get both? If she is wanting to be generous, why not just allow that and receive something that you really wanted in the process? It felt so awkward, even a little embarrassing, but I joined her up to the front, let go of all my withholds, and allowed it to happen. Her name was K and her son was a detective. Thank you K. You helped to deliver to me a little bust that ended up looking, not exactly alike, but quite similar to this statue which was found in the eastern harbor of Alexandria. Not only that, but doing so at a time that was extremely early along the journey. This is one of the few pieces of architecture left representing, what experts agree, is highly likely to be Ptolemy XV Caesarion. I was just barely getting started, on a trail of self perceived alien guidance and obsession with the number 47. It was like a soul seed being sown, a mindfuck waiting to sprout into a larger connection over a year + later.

Perhaps one of the most famous individuals of antiquity, 
Julius Caesar is a name that is recognized around the world. His military and political achievements transformed the world of ancient Rome. After his death, Julius was officially granted the title of "Divus" (divine), and became the first Roman ruler to be formally deified.

But where is it that this word, Caesar, originally came from?

Beginning as a family surname, Caesar has since evolved into a title, being donned by kings, emperors, dictators, aristocrats, even a salad and a Little pizza chain. 

The etymology of the name _Caesar_ is still unknown and subject to many interpretations, however, we can nail it down to about four possibilities. 

1. _caesaries_ ("long, flowing, luxuriant hair") 
	1. Since Caesar came from a family that historically suffered from premature balding, this was perhaps an ironic nickname given in jest. It's also possible the first Caesar may have been born with an abundant head of hair.
2. _caesiis oculis_ ("because of blue-grey eyes"):
	2. Historical record suggests that Julius Caesar had a piercing supernatural gaze with dark, grey, azure-colored, possibly black eyes. Perhaps he came from a lineage which was unique in their optometric coloring.  
3. _caesai_ ("elephant")
	1. Supported by the actions of Julius Caesar himself, it seems that this one was perhaps his favorite. Elephants were said to have been called caesai in the "Moorish", i.e. probably Punic language. The idea is that his family inherited the moniker from an ancestor, who had received the name after killing an elephant (presumably a war elephant), likely during the first Punic War (264–241 BC). Caesar utilized elephants in his military campaigns, such as during his conquest of Gaul and potentially Britain. He displayed an elephant on his first minted denarius (coin), printed on his own authority, without waiting for senate approval. Support for this connection was further demonstrated by his inclusion of forty elephants on the first day of his Gallic triumph in Rome.

![caesarelephant.jpg](/img/user/images/caesarelephant.jpg)

Pliny the Elder, Roman officer and encyclopedist, in his "Natural History," the largest single work to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day, suggested that the first individual to bear this name received it because he was born by being cut from his mother's womb (Latin: _a caeso matris utero_). 

Naturalis Historia, Chapter 7, section 47... (7.47)

47. It is a better omen when the mother dies in giving birth to the child; instances are the birth of the elder Scipio Africanus and of the first of the Caesars, who got that name from the surgical operation performed on his mother; the origin of the family name Caeso is also the same. Also Manilius who entered Carthage with his army was born in the same manner.

Essentially, Pliny connected the name "Caesar" to the act of being "cut" (from the Latin verb _caedere_, to cut), referring to an ancestor of Gaius Julius Caesar who was supposedly born via an early form of what would later be known as a Caesarean section.

The popular myth that Gaius Julius Caesar was personally born by C-section, and that the surgical procedure was named after him, is largely a later misunderstanding that developed over centuries. People likely simplified or misinterpreted Pliny's account about his ancestor.

At this time in history, a C-section delivery was essentially a death sentence. It wasn't until  ==1337==, when Beatrice of Bourbon, Countess of Armagnac, gave birth to a live child in Prague, that the first successful Cesarean section is recorded. It is highly unlikely, arguably impossible, that Julius was delivered by c-section himself, given the fact that his mother ends up surviving the birth, and living on nearly half a century, until around 10 years before his assassination. Had she miraculously survived an ordeal of this magnitude, changing history, especially given her royal status, we can be certain that tales of the event would have been etched quite heavily into the history books. 

"I was born by Caesarean section, but you really can't tell... except that when I leave my house, I always go out the window."- Steven Wright

There is a statement in the Talmud which is a bit strange. It is regards to the coming Moshiach, you know, the guy that redeems the entire world from bloodshed, oppression, greed and corruption - all that jazz. It describes him as "the Caesar,” and King David as a "half-Caesar."


לסוף כמה שנים מלך עליהם אחד בחזקה, שמתה אמו בלדתה ונבקעת בטנה ומצאוהו חי ומלך עליהם ונקרא קיסר בלשון רומי, והוא לשון כרות בעברית, ועל שמו נקראו כל המלכים שלאחריו קיסר.


"Rabbi Judah said in the name of Rav: The Holy One, blessed be He, will establish for the Jewish people another David, as it is written, And they shall serve the Lord their G-d, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them; not 'I raised up,' but 'I will raise up' is said. Rabbi Papa asked Abaye: But it is written, And my first servant David shall be their prince forever? They will be like a Caesar (emperor) and a half Caesar (viceroy). Moshiach, the new David, will be the Caesar and the original David will be the Viceroy, the half-Caesar."

Now, this is an interesting and particularly specific word choice. If we pay attention, the term that is often used for a king in the Torah and Talmud is "Melech," not Caesar. To refer to the second in command, we would see Mishneh LaMelech. not half-caesar. 

Why is it that suddenly, when it comes to the Moshiach, the man destined to become the greatest king of Israel, does the Talmud, a Hebrew text, choose this Latin term? Even more confusing is the fact that this title has been embraced by the very Emperors who were responsible for war against the Jews, and the destruction of the holy Temple itself. This is the exact opposite of what the Moshiach sets out to do; redeem the Jews, rebuild the Temple, and usher in an era of world peace filled with the universal knowledge of God. 

Tosefot, the commentary on the Talmud authored by the Ashkenazic scholars in Germany and France from the house of Rashi during the 12th and 13th centuries, explains the origin of the name Caesar:[3]

לסוף כמה שנים מלך עליהם אחד בחזקה, שמתה אמו בלדתה ונבקעת בטנה ומצאוהו חי ומלך עליהם ונקרא קיסר בלשון רומי, והוא לשון כרות בעברית, ועל שמו נקראו כל המלכים שלאחריו קיסר.

"Caesar in Latin means a cut, hence the English name for a “Cesarean Birth,” what we call today C-Section. When the fetus cannot exit the womb of its mother via the natural birth canal, the mother’s stomach is cut, and the fetus is extracted. This procedure, which was performed on a dead or dying mother, dates back around 700 years before Julius Caesar. In the Mishnah and the Talmud[4] we discuss the “Yotze Dofen,” the child who “comes out through a wall,” extracted from the mother’s abdomen and uterus, as a natural delivery is not possible.

Julius Caesar had a grandfather who was born through a Caesarian procedure. His mother died and they extracted the fetus through “the wall.” This child was thus given the name Caesar and it became the family name of all his descendants, including Julius. Thus, the title: Julius Caesar.[5]"

What truly is a leader? It is someone that does not follow, but instead directs forward - carving the path ahead. He can bring his people to new expanded horizons, leading them to previously uncharted terrains. A good leader opens new pathways in their own personal thinking processes, and this allows them to achieve things others cannot. They set a vision and then make the decisions which allow for them to accomplish that vision. The best way to describe this kind of personality is as a Caesar, that procedure which creates a "door" or an "opening" where nobody else was looking or saw possible. Where others see closed walls, this type of person sees a way through, he creates an unconventional opening. It is through this avenue that he extracts his vision, the child, from the divine mother we all share - cutting through that which was preventing delivery. He is the one that finally brings into to the world the gift of life, quite literally delivering deliverance, cutting through the veil. 

To quote Rabbi YY Jacobson,
	[TheYeshiva.net - Rabbi YY Jacobson](https://www.theyeshiva.net/jewish/item/7478/essay-last-days-of-pesach-moshiach-julius-caesar-moshiach-and-the-state-of-the-world)

"Moshiach will help people discover the inherent spirituality and unity of the entire universe and every creature in it. Such a leader must think “out of the box” in the most radical way, as he will reveal a new reality which the rest of us see as almost impossible. He will usher in the ultimate Caesarian birth: The “wall” which separates us from each other, the “wall” which separates us from infinity, the “wall” which eclipses our vision of the true integrated reality of our universe, will be opened and a new child, the child of peace and love, will emerge."

Just earlier this month, before I had done any sort of gematria on her name, my Mom took me to go to lunch with her and my Grandma. During the consumption of sushi, I attempted to relay all that was coming to me(without sounding like she would have to check me into a hospital). Having tried getting into things a little before, what I was saying never seemed to truly land or connect. Trying to explain things to my brother on another occasion, you could see the sadness in his eyes as he looked at his sibling too far gone - that I had completely lost myself in the sauce. At lunch I showed my Mom all the birthdates and started explaining everything to her, she was open and curious, I don't even think she knew who Cleopatra really was. We went to Grocery Outlet(the Bargain Market) and picked up some salsa right afterwards.

Last week, after researching further into what the 777 associated with her name could mean, I discovered that in the bible there were 2 Lamechs, one of which lived to 777 years. Trying to learn more, I found myself on a Quora answer with 777 views. 

![quora777.png| 300](/img/user/images/quora777.png)

Cleopatra viewed herself as an incarnation of Isis, and her son Caesarion, as an incarnation of Horus.

Aleister Crowley, arguably the world's most famous occultist, compiled a book titled "Liber 777," a massive and intricate table of correspondences across various occult systems, including Kabbalah, astrology, tarot, and comparative religion, making a name for itself as a classic in the genre. He famously identified himself as "The Beast 666" and believed he was a prophet spearheading a new spiritual age, the Aeon of Horus.

In 1917, during a series of magical experiments in New York known as the "Amalantrah Working," Crowley claimed to have made contact with an entity named **Lam**. He even drew a portrait of Lam, which some have noted bears a resemblance to modern depictions of "grey aliens."

![Supposed_channeled_entity_by_occultist_crowley.jpg](/img/user/images/Supposed_channeled_entity_by_occultist_crowley.jpg)

Aleister Crowley died in 1947. 

I was born and raised in Spokane Washington, which lies along the 47th parallel.

The creators of [[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/CIMBS\|CIMBS]] are located in Seattle Washington, which also lies along the 47th parallel.

In 2006, Jaak Panksepp, author of [[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/Archaeology of Mind\|Archaeology of Mind]] moved to Pullman Washington to accept the Bernice and Joseph Baily Chair in Animal Well-Being in the College of Veterinary Medicine, right below the 47th parallel.

One of the interesting details about this individual, Ptolemy Caesar, is that he is espoused to be, in some conspiracy theories, to actually be the "legitimate" story of Jesus. 

![caesarjesus.jpg](/img/user/images/caesarjesus.jpg)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzL9V1eylFw?si=96qFBvK1-tkYW8kl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, digging into this theory, I must say, even with the most generous eye, it doesn't seem to have enough substantial evidence to gain any sort of weight worthy of discussion. Perhaps I am not able to complete the difficult task of piecing together the truth of this matter, and I am failing the beings whom opened this can of worms and put their trust in me. 

But for one moment,
Imagine..... Jesus comes back, but to a world worshipping a false spin on his own story. He is tasked with the grand mission of righting his name and reconsolidating the tale with the truth which was lost in antiquity long ago...... but he can't just flat out tell everyone. There's a lot to live up to, and he himself is a bit troubled, still learning how to navigate things.  Little baby Jesus ( 8 pound, 6 ounce ). Everyone seems to be bowing down and trying to worship the image that they _think_ is him, believing he's got super powers and can walk on walls or pull bread out of thin air. But really, the embarrassing truth is, he's just a guy like any other guy. Sure, maybe he's just a little different in the way he understands things. Perhaps he has developed spiritually to a place that is remarkable, maybe even performing some miraculous things, but, imagine, could that not be the natural capacity of every man? What if, in actuality, we all had the capacity to step into a consciousness which was as powerful in its love as what has been attributed to this Jesus fella? By getting everyone to worship this false image of Christ, they would never in a million years step into their own divinity, their own capacity for connection to God. In trying to explain this to the world he is continuously battling the defense system installed into this false ideology by Satan himself. Red alerts begin to shoot up from the psyches of modern followers that this man is demonically possessed, trying to "Become Jesus," or "Become God," unable to submit and surrender to the truth of the story of Jesus Christ, the One and Only Begotten Son! Just let go of all this nonsense and accept the truth, stop fighting it, accept him in your heart... I'll pray for you... *cuts to scene of the real Jesus getting home after talking to a modern follower and punching a hole in his wall* 
It's a screenplay I'm working on, _Frustrations of the Little Lord_, his attempts to maintain grace..

Even if we completely discard this possibility that Caesarion was the real story of Jesus, something I eventually did after studying through the theory as much as I could(trust me I tried)...don't you worry, there is still hope for my messiah complex. An independent researcher by the name of Ralph Ellis was able to connect this exact familial lineage to the real story of Christ. 

![5169AQEZPWL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg](/img/user/images/5169AQEZPWL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)

Ralph Ellis has been researching biblical and Egyptian history for more than 30 years. Being separate from theological and educational establishments has allowed him to tread where others do not dare; perhaps even towards delusion, but it is here, in this free space, that Ralph discovered new interpretations on previously established biblical and historical truths. One such was that the real Jesus was a Great Grandson of Cleopatra.

It all started when he discovered a twist on the original biblical story hidden within the new testament, as-well as in real history. When you go to college, and you learn in a school, your mind is filled with its curriculum. You are learning what the establishment wants you to learn, and there are no gold stars awarded for those that go looking outside of these preestablished boundaries. In-fact, you will receive lashes across your knuckles, have your reputation tarnished, and your image laughed at - all the while you struggle to make ends meet. Alternative history can only come to the light when someone decides to go off that beaten path, to the road less traveled, and see for themselves where the trail leads and what truths may lie at its winding ends. 

Ralph first began to peer into this hidden world and have his perceptions shift when he was looking through the works of Josephus Flavius, perhaps Judea's most famous historian. This led him down a rabbit hole into a historical wonderland, within which, lied the first discovery of his - the Nativity story within the historical record. 

![500px-La_adorazione_dei_pastori_(Rubens,_Fermo).jpg| 300](/img/user/images/500px-La_adorazione_dei_pastori_(Rubens,_Fermo).jpg)
	Famous depiction of the Nativity scene by Peter Paul Rubens 1608.
		Sidenote, my Grandfather was named Ruben Natividad. (Spanish for nativity)
			His father was named Jesus Natividad, and his mother, Maria. 

Now... this entire nativity story is really quite a scene for, what is espoused to be, just the meager birth of a poor carpenter. 
.....but he wasn't just any carpenter, he was the king of the Jews!
Jesus was called a king 36 times throughout the New Testament, from his birth all the way to his crucifixion. 
But why was Herod afraid of a poor carpenter?
Because of some prophecy from the magi, he ordered the slaughter of... how many innocent children? What, did they steal this from the Chronos-Zeus myth?
Ralph argues that this is all hiding the fact that Jesus was an actual real king. 
Now... if Jesus was a real king, we should be able to find him in the historical records - with a little bit of nuance. This has to be an individual who was important enough to influence the events of the first century, but obscure enough to be lost completely to history. 
Where could we find such a king? 
It took Ralph 3 books of research to get there... but he made it, 
and it all starts with.....
drumroll please.....
### Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. 

The Ides of March, a roman holiday taking place on the 15th of the month, in the year of 44 BCE, was the famous day Julius was assassinated. Cleopatra happened to be in town at this time, and after his death, fearing for her life, fled back to Egypt with her son Caesarion(whom I am sure was quite handsome and well behaved). 

However, there is a detail which is truly quite mysterious, snuck into the records of Cicero - who was one of the great historians of the era. 
In a letter to a friend, he wrote
	"_I am grieved to hear of Tertia's loss of an expected child...(but) I should be glad of such a loss in the case of the queen (Cleopatra) and that expected scion of the breed of Caesar._"

So here he is saying that Cleopatra was pregnant when she was fleeing back to Egypt. It could not have been a reference to Caesarion who was already 3 years old. What happens to this child? We never hear anything further. 

Fast forward 20 years or so to the reign of Octavian Augustus, who kept a bunch of orphans in the Royal Palace of Rome. While consolidating the borders of Rome, the first thing he does is go to Mauritania North Africa. This area was ruled by an independent monarchy, but still subservient to Rome, and so he had to keep the provinces happy. To satisfy their King Juba the second (not Jabba the hut), he gave to him Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Cleopatra and Mark Antony. Alright, so now the southern borders of Rome are satisfied. Octavian now pivots his head towards the east, where the lands of Parthia lie, ruled over by Phraates IV (a man you have probably never heard of, but could perhaps recognize from your pack of playing cards).

![161.jpg](/img/user/images/161.jpg)

The dynamic between Rome and Parthia was important due to the fact that Parthia was their greatest threat, having already defeated them twice in the past. During the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, they had taken Rome's military standards (emblems, symbols, several statues of eagles etc.) and Octavian knew that on some level Rome may or may not have been able to handle an attack from them. This diplomatic relationship was of great importance. What does he decide to do? Give King Phraatess IV a concubine of course, but not just any concubine..... Thea Musa... a random slave girl/prostitute??

You have probably not heard anything about her either. Thea Musa receives no specific mention in any Latin source. Academics have argued that the omission of her narrative is deliberate. Even though she was mentioned in the records of Josephus Flavius, she was still thought to be fictional and made up until some of her coins began to pop up all across the east of Parthia. 

This is interesting. 
Juba II, who was a minor monarch of North Africa, not much of a threat.... he gets a royal Egyptian princess - the daughter of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony.
Big dawg Phraates IV, the one whom is actually a danger and whose relationship is vital to maintain, he gets some random slave orphan who was supposedly from Italy. 
That doesn't seem to make much sense (although perhaps she was a stunner.)
Even further, he ends up being so pleased with Thea that he makes her his primary wife and the Queen of all Parthia(modern day Persia).

Ralph hypothesizes that this is the missing daughter of Cleopatra, the one she had with Julius Caesar. In his book he gives a few reasons, one of which is .... well they just look the same. Small mouth, slightly receding chin.... the nose. She was no concubine, but a princess descended from the monarchies of Egypt, Macedonia, Rome, etc.

![TheaCleopatra.png](/img/user/images/TheaCleopatra.png)

Now, Thea didn't seem to stay in Parthia for very long...

"At first Phraates treated Thea Musa as a concubine, but... after she had a son named Phraataces, he declared her his lawful wife and held her in honour. ... Phraataces... considered it a dangerous and tedious thing to have power handed over by his father; so he plotted with the assistance of his mother, to do away with his father. There is also a story that he had sexual relations with his mother. He was detested for both reasons.... and was embroiled in civil war before he had gathered much strength, and driven from the throne."

So here we have Queen Thea Musa Aranea of Parthia and her son Phraataces being driven into exile out of Parthia. It also seems to have a... 'younger child usurping the throne of the king' theme similar to the nativity story. Where did they go to? Well, Josephus Flavius picks things back up. 

"When (Herod) understood that there was a man that was a Jew was come out of Babylon, with five hundred horsemen... and a hundred of his relations, and had passed over the Euphrates and now abode at Antioch. (Herod) sent for this man and promised to give him land tax free"

This is not explicitly stated to be the same story, but Roman historians have confirmed that this is where they went to... to Syria. 

At this time, around AD 4 or so, this Herod would have likely been Herod Archelaus. He sent for this royal family and promised them land in the eastern part of his province free of tax. Those lands ended up being on the Eastern borders of Syria, and the eastern borders of Judea. The idea here was that if Herod were to give this royal family some land towards the East, this region could act as a buffer region between his own domain and the Parthian monarchy(which they did for 200-300 years). He calls them Babylon Jews ... and they were. They came out of Parthia, which was old Babylon. They were Jews, being partially Jewish through their ancestry (in further works Ralph argues the original Israelite leaders were actually pharaohs of Egypt), but also because this particular group was initiated into Nazarene Judaism around AD 50(this is confirmed in the Talmud). Josephus consistently refers to the Babylonian Jews and to "our countrymen beyond the Euphrates." These are the people he's talking about, Thea Musa Aranea and Phraataces after they came out of Parthia and settled in, one of the 16 different cities titled Antioch at the time, this one being the one in northern Syria just across the Euphrates. 

In the original nativity story depicted within the Gospel of Luke, we have a census ordered by Emperor Caesar Augustus, for taxation purposes, which required for Joseph and pregnant Mary to travel to Bethlehem for registration in Joseph's ancestral town. So we have a royal family(keep in mind Jesus is called a king) on the run in Judea-Syria, something to do with taxation. They have nowhere to stay, and so they must lodge themselves in a stable(perhaps there is no palace built for this new royalty quite yet). Then they are visited by 3 magi. Persia aka Parthia followed the religion of Zoroastrianism. The Greek word used for the wise men was "magos" which refers to teachers, wise men, and priests from Persia.

Why would 3 priests be visiting the Syria-Judea region all the way from Parthia? For the birth of some carpenter? Because they have some sort of spiritual guidance from a star in the sky that leads them like a gps to the pregnant belly of a woman holding a superhero inside of her?

“Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him” (Matthew 2:2, NKJV). 

Or... perhaps.... was this child being delivered an actual king? 
The Queen and King of Parthia, on the run, having just been exiled... 
Would this baby, given his heritage, not be a potential Prince of Persia himself?
Of course the Parthian priests would arrive to witness the birth of a potential future King, one whose blood would be quite royal(especially accounting for Caesar and Cleopatra).   

Furthermore, after they land in this new region, to align the history correctly, what we see is that Thea Musa (the alleged daughter of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra) becomes Queen Helena of Adiabene. But wait - wasn't Helena supposed to be from Adiabene originally? Ralph argues this is historical misdirection. Helena was the _founder_ of Adiabene's royal dynasty, not born into it. Phraataces V becomes King Monobazus I of Adiabene. After their exile from Parthia, they needed new identities and a new kingdom. The eastern borders of the Roman client states provided the perfect opportunity.

This is where Ralph begins to get a little audacious, if he hasn't been already. According to his research, Thea Musa and Phraataces had additional children after settling in their new kingdom. 










In a later book, what was a discovery only after he was already multiple books deep into research, was that the real story of Jesus stems from the King of Edessa, Manus the VI. That's right, Ralph Ellis claims to have found the biblical Jesus in the historical record. He was not a peaceful preacher, but instead, the leader of the Jewish Revolt against Rome in AD 66-70. From this point forth I will simply share with you all of Ralph's perspective on this issue, not claiming it is accurate or not, but simply his theory.

Joseph Flavius states that the Edessans initiated the Jewish Revolt. The Kingdom of Edessa, located in northern Syria, has been the missing piece of the puzzle. Rome intentionally deleted this truth from history because they wanted to take away the memory of these powerful rebels to prevent future uprisings, and because the Edessan monarchy was too closely linked to what ended up becoming the biblical story. This is where the Catholic Church assisted in its deletion.  

The doctrine of Addai is a text (from the 3rd or 4th century) describing letters and ambassadors being sent between the biblical Jesus, and King Abgarus of Edessa.

King Abgarus sends ambassadors to Jerusalem, who see Jesus. A scribe named Hanan documents all of Jesus's actions. Abgarus writes to Jesus because he wants him to cure him of an illness and cannot visit Jerusalem himself. This was due, not only to his weak body, but to Roman travel restrictions. Historical sources, the records of Dio Cassius, seem to confirm that Abgarus was earlier held as a hostage in Rome. Hanan meets with Jesus at the house of Gamaliel (the same Gamaliel from the Book of Acts) and paints a portrait of Jesus. This portrait is then brought back to King Abgarus. It later became well revered and known as the "Mandylion", which means “towel” or “napkin” in Greek. Tradition claims that the image was created when Jesus pressed a cloth to his face, leaving his features imprinted upon it. In the text, these events are said to occur under the reign of Emperor Tiberius (which ends in 37 AD), but this was an alteration so that things would align with the Gospels. However, it seems that the details inside refer to a Roman governor of Syria known as "Marinus Sabinas." 



THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED DURING THE FAMINE OF 47 AD

In AD 47, Paul embarked on his first missionary journey, commissioned by the Holy Spirit.


 "Jesus" comes from the Persian name **Izas**, not the Aramaic "Joshua." The Arabic name for Jesus, "Isa," supports this.

 Matthew's prophecy states the messiah would be called **Emmanuel**. While the Gospels never call him this, the speaker claims it was the final piece of the puzzle.
- The two figures are thus equated:
    - **Historical King:** King Izas **Manu** of Edessa
    - **Biblical King:** King Jesus **Emmanuel** of Judea

Kind Izas was crucified next to two other individuals in the same manner as Jesus.
After the revolt, Josephus (working for Titus Caesar) saw three of his "former acquaintances" being crucified. Since Josephus had worked for the Edessan monarchy, these were the Edessan royals. He had them taken down from their crosses, and while two died, **one survived**.

Jesus was crucified with two others. He was taken down early from the cross at the request of **Joseph of Arimathea**. The two stories are presented as accounts of the same event. **Joseph of Arimathea** is identified as being **Josephus Flavius**.

 The Gospels state Jesus was crucified wearing a purple robe and a "plaited crown of thorns."  This was not a mock crown of twisted twigs, but the traditional ceremonial regalia of the Kings of Edessa.

Coins of King Abgarus show him wearing a plaited, thorn-like crown. The purple robe was a symbol of imperial authority, and by wearing it, the Edessan king was signaling rebellion against Rome.

 In AD 66, with Emperor Nero's power failing, **King Izas Manu VI** launched the Jewish Revolt not just to control Judea, but as a stepping stone to seize the throne of Rome itself.

I ultimately don't have any idea whether or not Ralph's claims have any validity to them. I am admittedly not intelligent enough around these subjects to be able to make a decision. I also have an enormous cognitive bias towards wanting to believe all of this to be true, as I am bought into the idea that I am Caesarion, and this would make me Jesus's Great uncle. In navigating different criticisms of Ralph online, I noticed that he was very present in the comment section of all the different blogs challenging him. He would respond to their queries in a fearless manner, continuing to stand behind his claims and never backing down. This level of self belief doesn't necessarily mean he is correct. He may be so deep down the rabbit hole into Alice's Wonderland that he could be making all sorts of inappropriate connections that are ultimately false and utterly ridiculous. Perhaps I am talking about myself and my own writing here as-well. With no academic establishment to check and hold him to rigor, Ralph could make his own rules and craft an entire world that makes complete sense to him... and anyone who reads his books without an education on the topics at hand. These individuals, with their shortsightedness, could then validate his work and make him feel like he's really onto something, fueling the narrative. 

If we could however fantasize for a moment and simply assume that everything Ralph Ellis tries to point us towards is true, this would be one of the greatest discoveries of the millennium. In a world that is, well, a madhouse, it would make complete sense that the man who has discovered the truth of this very complex matter would have few to no ears even open to hearing his discoveries. Everyone is distracted. Christians are too deeply entrenched into and attached to their already established beliefs. Historians and scholars would not want to break away from what has already been set as their ideas of the past and into the books they've read. The puzzle which has been laid out before us is incredibly complex and would take a tremendous amount of mental energy to digest fully. If modern Christianity were to be completely wrong, and Ralph correct, he would be facing an impossible task attempting to persuade even the deepest of Jesus's fans. They wouldn't even want the truth. It would be a disappointing let-down from the fantastical story which may have fueled them with feelings of empowerment and spiritual inspiration their entire lives. In the same way that the Jesus in the biblical story is seen as heretical troublemaker by the Roman's, Ralph Ellis is often seen as a complete cook who is trying way to hard to push his own ideas into rewriting history..... even if potential holds that he may be 100% spot on.

My card failed trying to buy groceries. Someone ended up buying them for me. Feeling blessed I entered into a 2 hour conversation with a homeless man in front of the Natural Grocers. Actually one of the best talks I've had with someone. This took shortly after leaving my dishwashing job(not telling him this), and he happened to share with me his favorite song "Jesus Does the Dishes."

Going to the library to silently read a book, after work at said dishwashing job, a woman sits down next to me and breaks the silence "Do you know Jesus?" and begins to, for the next 40 minutes, in the silence of the library, preach to me. She was very nice. I'm glad the people at AT&T were able to help get her phone working. Of course we all have come across enthusiastic Christians, but this experience was just so profoundly odd it was as if she was part of the worlds attempt to gaslight me into this weird messiah madness.

## Receipts

I found myself stumbling upon this receipt in my cherished Channel 5 merch hoodie, one I had not worn in about 4-5 months. Searching the pockets of every clothing item which I owned, in search of one of my andara crystals - so that I could hold it in my left hand during meditation ([[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] secret), suddenly I found myself stepping into the remembrance of a profound moment. As my hand came across a folded note and opened it up it all came back to me. I had gone to the bank to withdraw cash, in efforts to procure for myself the strongest oil infused marijuana joint that money could buy (for maybe $5). Lying in the dispenser responsible for printing receipts was a piece of inked thermal paper, left unwanted by the previous ATM attendee. Upon it was a unique pair of numbers which had a frightening significance for me. A remaining balance stood at 2000.47, the first half of the digits the year which I was born, the second.. also... the year in which I was born? I find it worth mentioning, that it seems the date on which this occurred was the night of Halloween - where the veil between the two worlds is supposedly its thinnest.

Here's another one I got on a trip to the Burlington Coat Factory the summer after the training ended. I bought some crocs that I was considering using for gardening, but ultimately decided that they wouldn't really be the best workwear - refunding it afterwards. However, why did I even feel that it was a decent option in the first place? looking back I was just following the flow not really thinking too thoroughly about things.

Just a regular ol' trip to the grocery store

On one of the glorious ritualistic trips to Panera Bread I love to share with my grandmother - a few times a year - we happened to get the special number. This was earlier in the journey where I was actually very terrified about my mental health and obsession with the number, being with my sweet Grandma made it feel safe - a sign to keep going even though it felt I was entering a prolonged psychosis of the Jim Carrey Number 23 variety.

4x7=28, roughly the cycle of the moon 

_The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn are 47 degrees of latitude apart_.

The solar system is flat, with the planets orbiting the sun on the same plane, known as the ecliptic. **Earth rotates on an axis tilted by 23.4 degrees with respect to this ecliptic, causing the sun to rise and set within almost 47 degrees** — a range it gradually covers over an entire year.

Approximately 71 days before and after inferior conjunction, Venus reaches a position called elongation, when the planet lies at its greatest angular distance from the Sun, which is about 47 degrees. At eastern elongation it is the Evening Star, and can be seen for up to a few hours after sunset before setting to the west. When it is at its western elongation, it becomes the Morning Star, visible to the eastern horizon up to a few hours before dawn.

"But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
	Revelation 2:25

 “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
	Revelation 22:16

"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!"
	Isaiah 14:12 (KJV)

"How you have fallen from heaven, you star of the morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, you who defeated the nations!"
	Isaiah 14:12 (NASB)

Lucifer, in the Isaiah quote, being interchanged with morning star amongst different biblical editions.

If we pay attention to those two passages, we see that both Jesus, and Lucifer, are designated as "The Morning Star."

(The Morning Star, or "Day Star" refers to the Planet Venus in the Sky)

We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. 20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
	2 Peter 1:19-21

Before we continue it should be noted that the work of [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] comes from a 6th dimensional collective consciousness which supposedly evolved out of Venus. 

In both English and Simple Gematria, Jesus and Lucifer have the exact same numerical quantity.

Hebrew name Shani (שָׁנִי) means "scarlet" or "crimson"


![Shani_Deva.jpg|400](/img/user/images/Shani_Deva.jpg)

In Hinduism, Shani, or Shanaishchara, is considered the "God of Time" as well as the God of karma, justice, and retribution.
He is also called _Saneeswar/Shaneeswar_ meaning "Lord of Saturn," and is the personification of the planet Saturn. 
Shani is believed to be an incarnation of Krishna, atleast in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, where Krishna claims that he is "Shani among planets."

Kali is the female deity associated with Saturn. I explain some of my profoundly intimate experience with Kali in [[The Inner Garden/𖥱 Dedication\|𖥱 Dedication]]. To summarize, my second time chanting the Kali mantra I totaled my car into a woman whose license plate is the same gematria value as Revelations 7:4 (the one specifically mentioning the 144,000). My license plate is AZZ, similar to Azazel, the scapegoat.

![Chronos_and_his_child.jpg](/img/user/images/Chronos_and_his_child.jpg)

Cronos was the ancient Greek - first born and leader of the titans; associated with the harvest, agriculture, and the Golden Age. Cronus was later adopted as the Roman deity Saturn, also solidifying a day of the week, Saturday.

Chronos, quite similar in spelling, was different, being the primordial essence of time itself, its personification. Eventually, within greek culture, the two merged and blended into one another. 

Hesiod: Works and Days is the first work which explores this Golden Age of Saturn.
It was thought of 

primarily known for ==his epic poem, The Aeneid==. He is considered one of Rome's greatest poets, and The Aeneid is regarded as Rome's national epic.
Virgil's Ecologue 4 predicts the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who - once he is of age - will become divine and eventually rule over the world.

now a new generation is sent down from high heaven."

In the formative centuries of Christianity, papyrus served as the predominant writing material throughout the Mediterranean world, particularly in Egypt where the climate gave ideal conditions for its preservation. Consequently, papyrus manuscripts often constitute the most ancient direct textual evidence for the New Testament.  

Among these invaluable witnesses, catalogued under the Gregory-Aland system, the earliest known fragment is likely the very brief **Papyrus 98 (P98)** (2nd century). However P98 is _highly_ fragmentary, only preserving small portions of several chapters. The next in the lineage, lies **Papyrus 47 (P47)**. While technically not the oldest known fragment, it preserves a much larger, actually continuous block of text – roughly the middle third of Revelation (chapters 9-17). Being so early and substantial in its size, P47 provides scholars with the earliest extensive text for this section of Revelation, significantly closer in time to the original late 1st-century writing than many later manuscripts, despite its relatively informal script. Another key papyri, is **Papyrus 18 (P18)**, a 3rd/4th-century fragment containing Revelation 1:4-7. It is notable for being written on the back of a reused Exodus scroll fragment, early Christians demonstrating the timelessness of the reduce reuse and recycle theorem.

If you have a spare $170, you can purchase for yourself the doctoral dissertation which was written analyzing this single Papyrus fragment, P47 
	[P. Beatty III (P47): The Codex, Its Scribe, and Its Text (New Testament Tools, Studies and Documents, 52): Malik, Peter: 9789004340435: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Beatty-III-P47-Testament-Documents/dp/9004340432)

It is here, showing up in the final book of the New Testament, The Book of Revelation (or Book of the Apocalypse), a work by John the Apostle, that we are first exposed to the importance of the number 144, or 144,000. Originally written in Greek, it derives its title from the first word of the text - apokalypsis, meaning 'unveiling,' 'disclosure,' or 'revelation.'

![apokalypsos.png](/img/user/images/apokalypsos.png)

In the Book of Revelation, there is a prophecy foretold that there will be 144,000 “sealed” by God. That is, 12,000 members from each of the 12 tribes of Israel, supposed to be saved from the rapture and redeemed from the Earth when the gates of hell are opened. 

Some interpret this to mean that the 144,000 will be recently converted Jewish evangelists, becoming Christian’s who are protected by the wrath of God at the end of times. High priests, endowed with special power to be an elite missionary force. They are sealed and won’t be harmed by the destruction to come. The word ‘seal’ has a very interesting historical background behind it. One of the purposes of sealing in the ancient world, was to authenticate contracts, laws, invoices, treaties, and military orders (amongst other things). Today we use signatures, but in ancient times, kings and rulers wore metal rings that were engraved with their name, initials, or some sort of imagery representing themselves. To seal a document, a bit of wet clay or hot wax would be placed on the opening fold of the paper. Then the ring would be pressed into the wax/clay, leaving the seal’s imprint on it. The document was thereby officially identified with and under the authority of the person to whom, what they referred to as a signet, belonged. Seals were related to ownership, authenticity, security and authority. Any person but the king who broke or disturbed that seal would likely have forfeited their life in exchange.

In this way, the 144,000 has been interpreted to be under the ownership of God, his chosen servants. Imbued with the seal of the Holy Spirit to help bring sinners to Jesus Christ, they are tasked with preaching the gospel endlessly throughout the first half of the brutal 7 year apocalyptic Tribulation period. The reception of the Holy Spirit is a seal of ownership in two senses – the first being God’s ownership over oneself, but the second, one’s ownership over their portion of the heavenly inheritance. These are the individuals who will inherit the New Earth, mind you. Before the angels begin unleashing God’s fury on the world, they must seal up the 144,000 for protection. Once this has been achieved, the four winds of God’s wrath will be released, and the Great Tribulation begins. Dun dun duuuuun

“After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the Earth, holding back the four winds of the Earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels _who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:_ ‘Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees _until_ we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.’ Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.”
	Revelations 7:1-4

Another interpretation, however, is that the 144,000 is simply symbolic. It is referring to all Christians. Numbers in apocalyptic literature were intended to be read without upholding them to exact precision. 12 is a holy number. It is a symbol of faith, the church, and divine government. In total, it appears 187 times in the Bible. It reflects the 12 months of a lunar year. There are 12 tribes of Israel, descending from the 12 sons of Jacob. Jesus chose to have 12 apostles. A lot of holiness surrounding this number. 144 is 12 times 12. So if 12 is really holy, then 144 is like… holy squared. If ancient authors wanted to signify a lot of people, they would say 1,000. So 12,000…. that’s a buuuunch of people. The 144,000 is simply a plethora of holy individuals, made up from each of the Tribes of Israel.

This particular section of the text gives evidence for this second perspective.

"After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
	Revelation 7:9-10

It can also be interpolated that this influx of individuals, which can’t be accounted for, is resultant of the original 144,000 witnesses having worked their magic. Their attempts to evangelize the world, helping to convert their fellow man as it crumbles, ultimately being fruitful.

One of the more modern spiritual interpretations, outside of the realm of the Religious, is that the 144,000 is not a literal number of people, but it is simply in reference to all - not Christians - but individuals whom have achieved a level of consciousness in which they see the nature of unity in all things. This frame served as the basis for what evolved further, being remodeled and revised into the modern new age interpretation which we see prevalent today - that the 144,000 are "Starseeds." These are celestial volunteers descend from ascended worlds/realms, spawning inside of the Earthly sphere to provide their higher level of consciousness as a support, in service to help others on their journey of ascension. They have incarnated into the physical human form with a dormant mission at hand, to wake everyone up. This, theoretically, will raise the collective consciousness level of the planet, and we will, at some point, be living in a world that is refined from its inadequacies - a New Earth. The spinning rock we find ourselves on, being polished, is described as a restored and perfected version of the Garden of Eden, a return to a renewed and even more glorious paradise, one where sin and suffering no longer exist.

Here the New Agers still end up running into this same issue of a number which seems itself to quite limiting, 144,000. Of course we run into the spiritual trap which is presented as-well - am I one of the special advanced chosen ones? Ohhhh life is so hard, I'm not from here - I am a brave, honorable, selfless warrior from a foreign land - not built for this place. Take me to your leader, I have come bringing my advanced frequency, to activate genetic gifts dormant within my extraterrestrial DNA for the collective. There are much more awakening souls on our planet, or so it seems, than the quantity presented - could it be in reference to anything else?

![nadis.jpg](/img/user/images/nadis.jpg)

The Tantras speak of Nadis, channels for the flow of consciousness. Nadi (नाड़ी) means flow, river, tube, or pathway. There are said to be 36,000 on each side of the body, both positive and negative, totaling 72,000. These nadis are believed to be pathways through which Prana (life force energy) flows. In the same way that electricity flows through wires, the vital force (prana shakti), mind force (manas shakti) and kundalini energy (mahaprana) flow through the nadis. Blockages in Nadis are created through the accumulation of toxins, negative thoughts/energies, disease, and negative samskaras(karma). There are three main nadis. Ida is considered the passive, feminine, yin energy channel, which controls the mental processes. Pingala is the active, masculine, yang energy channel, which controls the vital processes. Sushumna is the central, neutral energy channel that passes through the spine, through which, the cosmic energy of spiritual awakening flows(when Ida and Pingala are balanced). When Ida and Pingala awaken at the base of the spine, they are meant to move in synergy up in a spiral motion to the central channel of the shushumna. Here they unite at the third eye center, awakening the higher spiritual organs of perception. Once the 72,000 channels have been brought into unity through the three main nadis, or so some of the New Age philosophers speaks of, they supposedly double in their power - to 144,000. An amplification, a x2 which occurs once things balance and rise, coming into union, the system flows openly. 

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 223258.png| 500](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-03-03%20223258.png)

Another way we get to this number is through the petals of the chakra system. 
The root has 4 petals, the sacral 6, solar plexus has 10, the heart has 12, and the throat has 16. This equals 48. The third eye chakra is represented by 2 petals. If we take the sum of the lower 5 chakras, and multiply it by two(48x2), we get 96. If we then add this together, 96+48, we get to 144. The crown chakra, or thousand petal lotus has, well, 1,000 petals. Multiply the 144 by 1,000, and you again result back at this number - 144,000.

![144Nadis.jpg](/img/user/images/144Nadis.jpg)

People who begin to see 144 all over the place, you'd be surprised there's quite a few of them on the internet, are said to be undergoing an awakening process on the physiological level. The number 144 is supposedly reflected back to them through their universe as their body is undergoing physiological upgrades, even down to the minute level of the mitochondria. DNA is upgrading evolving and expanding, as ones consciousness is raising itself in vibration. When our consciousness is awakening, our frequency begins to rise. We are not simply exiting the mental slumber we were in separate from the body. The actual frequency of our energy body is raising itself in hertz, our spiritual-electric charge is amplifying. The subtle body becomes capable of holding more and more life-force/prana, requiring more as-well in order to maintain and stabilize the heightened, ascended state of consciousness. 

Some even theorize the 144,000 are reincarnations of the previous prophets and pious saints, all together, meeting in the end of times, once and for all, to establish the divine just state, heaven on earth.

There is one other reference to 144 in Revelations. The Apostle John beholds a breathtaking sight: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away" (Revelation 21:1). This is the renewed creation – the arrival of the Holy City. Describing it as it walks down the isle, "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (Revelation 21:2). A great voice from the throne proclaims "'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God'" (Revelation 21:3) It represents the end of sorrow and suffering, for God "'will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away'" (Revelation 21:4). 
The city doesn't need the sun or moon because "the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb Jesus Christ is its lamp" (Revelation 21:23). John observed "And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls."(Revelation 21:15)

![measuringrod.jpg](/img/user/images/measuringrod.jpg)

"The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal." (Revelation 21:16)

![12000furloughs.jpg](/img/user/images/12000furloughs.jpg)

![fifteenhundredmiles.jpg](/img/user/images/fifteenhundredmiles.jpg)



Continuing, recording its impressive dimensions... "He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel's measurement. The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, like clear glass." (Revelation 21:17-18)

The precious gemstone **Jasper** paired with the number **144** also show up in a completely different context - the world of Marvel. Comic book history is often divided into distinct periods; the Golden Age came first, then the Silver Age (roughly spanning the late 1950s to the early 1970s), followed by the Bronze and Modern Ages. The series _Strange Tales_, featuring Doctor Strange and Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., reached issue number **144** in May 1966, right in the heart of the Silver(47) Age. Within the pages of _Strange Tales_ #144, amidst tales of espionage and mysticism, Marvel Comics introduced a brand new character in the Nick Fury story: Agent _Jasper_ Sitwell.

The total sum of the interior angles of all five Platonic solids is 14,400 degrees.

720∘+1440∘+2160∘+6480∘+3600∘=14,400∘

The Octahedron, representing the element of air has a sum of 1440∘.

In esoteric practices, Air fundamentally symbolizes the power of the mind, intellect, rational thought, communication, and the vital breath of life. The Air Element is the fourth Chakra, the heart center, Anahata.  The higher emotions of the Heart are expressive of unconditional love, thus the Air Element acts as a medium of expression for the Spirit Element above, which channels these
higher love energies. "Ruach HaKodesh" (רוח הקודש) is the Hebrew term for "Holy Spirit". It literally translates to "wind of holiness" or "spirit of holiness".

According to the Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, the 47th name of the 72 Shem HaMephorash angels is Ayin Shin Lamed. The meaning, at least from some modern sources - Global transformation begins in your own heart.

Guardian angel, Asaliah – _“God Who Reveals the Truth”_

This is closely related to the Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam, which states that if you want to repair the world, you need to _start_ with _yourself_. This is called Tikkun Ha-Lev (Repairing the Heart).

Shabbetai Zevi was born in the city of Smyrna, where he grew up and received a sound grounding in the Talmud. He was ordained as a Rabbi at the early age of 18. Later he steeped himself in the mystical writings of the Kabbala. Shabbetai was born on 9th of Av, the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple but also, according to tradition, the day on which the coming Messiah will be born. At 22, Shabbetai declared himself to be that very individual. 

The news spread rapidly throughout the Jewish world. There was even talk of Shabbetai assembling a Jewish army to reconquer the Holy Land. Jewish communities everywhere were being captivated by these events, giving many their first real taste of religious enthusiasm. The year 1666 is particularly significant in Jewish history due to the events surrounding Shabbatai Zevi, and in February of that year he was imprisoned by the head of the Ottoman state. At the height of his messianic influence, he was forced to make a decision. Facing charges of sedition, he had to either convert to Islam, or be killed. Shabbatai converted, ensuring his life, and letting down the world of Judaism. He was proclaimed the false messiah, and all the hype which he had built, was a let-down. Sabbatai is perhaps most responsible for what the world of modern Judaism has shaped itself into. He is the reason that they began to put restrictions on the who can learn Kabbala, mainly that you had to be 40 years old, and with a life that can ground your spiritual ventures.

Sabbatai Zevi interpreted "Tikkun Olam" (repairing the world) through a radical lens, believing that during the Messianic Age, even acts traditionally considered sinful could become righteous. Nathan of Gaza, Sabbatais messianic spokesperson and cheerleader, came up with a unique philosophy to account for his conversion. He argued that the Messiah's mission required a descent into the realm of the _Qlippoth_ (the "husks" or "shells" representing evil and impurity in Lurianic Kabbalah) It was necessary to battle the forces of darkness from within to liberate the trapped sparks of divine light. Descent was seen as a paradoxical, necessary part of the _Tikkun_ (rectification) process. His task involves confronting, entering, even almost becoming - before ultimately subduing or rectifying, the Qlippothic forces. These were often symbolized by the Dragon/Serpent.

![Pasted image 20250419060536.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250419060536.png)

In Hebrew, Sabbatai means Saturn. In Jewish tradition, "the reign of Sabbatai," the highest planet, was often linked to the advent of the Messiah. 

"Sabbatai Zevi himself was much taken by gematria- in fact, much of his energy following his declaration of his messiahship was spent on discovering gematriot that would prove his messiahship or indicate his spiritual perfection. For example, he discovered in 1665 that the gematria of his name, Sabbatai Zevi, was identical to that of the phrase “the true messiah”

Da'at (sometimes Da'ath) , דעת ,  has a gematria value of 474.

![Screenshot 2025-06-10 170220.png](/img/user/images/Screenshot%202025-06-10%20170220.png)

It roughly translates to "knowledge" or "consciousness"
Not knowledge about the outside world or others,
but about the self, the one who is doing the knowing, the I. 
Less factual and intellectual, more relational and experiential. 
It's not readily accessible to everyone, and often requires a specific spiritual journey.
The _doorway_ to this _knowledge_ is what we seek when we enter into a religion, or any kind of spirituality, and is often thought of as hidden, locked away, and needing to be earned through dedication and faith. Doorway is a term used quite literally here, and is described by Jesus in Matthew 7:7-8

>“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

In Hebrew, the letters have a special meaning which contribute to the words they construct. Each of the 22 letters encapsulate some part of creation. The first letter of the word Da'at, daleth ד, quite literally symbolizes a doorway/gate in the Hebrew language. 

![daleth.jpeg](/img/user/images/daleth.jpeg)

That doorway, which Da'at is, finds its symbolic place within the Garden of Eden as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
The Tree of the Knowledge (of good and evil) is Da-at. 
																הַדַּ֖עַת-Had-da-‘aṯ
"of the knowledge"
Like any doorway, you can go through it in two different directions.
The special knowledge one gains passing through Da'at, and how it is used,
is resultant of the will and intentions of the person stepping across. 
Good or evil, it's not the gun but the person wielding it.

The best example I could think of here, is Da'ath Vader. 

The lore of Anakin Skywalker evolving into Darth Vader is what forms the crux of the Star Wars saga. Qui-Gon and Padmé meet little Skywalker at Watto’s shop while looking for parts after their ship was damaged. Just a young slave boy, Anakin’s kindness, confidence, and intelligence make a strong first impression on them. Later they witness him pod-racing — a dangerous sport which takes extraordinary reflexes, which the young child not only survives, but wins. Qui-Gon, quite impressed, takes a blood sample and has Obi-Wan analyze it remotely. Obi-Wan reports that Anakin’s midi-chlorian count, the microscopic cells that let beings sense and use the Force, is over 20,000, higher than any Jedi on record — even Yoda. The boys mother, Shmi Skywalker, tells Qui-Gon Jinn that her son was conceived without a father, but she could not explain how it happened -a mysterious and miraculous “virgin birth.” All of this begins to build in Qui-Gon's head and leads him to believe Anakin might be the greatly anticipated Chosen One, prophesied by the earliest Jedi philosophers to defeat the Sith Lord and bring balance back to the Force once and for all. 

Qui-Gon negotiates Anakin’s freedom and leaves Tatooine with him.

Following his discovery, Anakin's path seemed set. He was freed from slavery and brought to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to be trained. However, the Jedi Council, wary of his age and the palpable negativity residing in him from his life as a slave, initially refused to train him. It was an intuitive recognition that he stood at Da'ath's precipice. Master Yoda sensed the "fear" and "anger" in the boy, but what he was really detecting was the dangerous proximity to that mystical abyss where knowledge without wisdom becomes corruption. After this denial, the team then returns to Naboo to help Queen Amidala liberate her planet. During the Battle of Naboo, Qui-Gon faces Darth Maul with Obi-Wan and is killed dueling the dual sabered saber tooth Da'ath Mall. It was only Qui-Gon's dying wish, for Skywalker to become a Jedi and ultimately restore balance to the Force, that convinced the council to allow Obi-Wan Kenobi, himself just a newly-minted Knight, to take Anakin as his Padawan. 

Anakin’s training under Obi-Wan was a mixture of incredible progress and deep-seated frustration. He was powerful, learning faster than any student in the Temple's history, yet he was also impatient and arrogant. He felt the Jedi Order was holding him back, their rigid codes and demands for emotional detachment feeling like another form of bondage.

The critical moment comes when Anakin must choose between saving Mace Windu (representing the established order, the Light) or saving Palpatine (representing the promise of power to save Padmé). This is his Da'ath moment - the mystical crossroads where knowledge transforms into either wisdom or corruption.

When Anakin strikes down Windu, he doesn't just commit murder; he steps fully through the Da'ath gateway into the Qliphothic realm of the Sith. Entering the Tree of Death, Anakin Skywalker is effectively "killed" and imprisoned within the mechanical shell of Darth Vader.




Master Yoda sensed the "fear" and "anger" in the boy, but what he was really detecting was the dangerous proximity to that mystical abyss where knowledge without wisdom becomes corruption.


Star Wars is a retelling of the ancient mystical drama of fall and redemption played out against the backdrop of a galactic civil war. Whether George Lucas did this all intentionally or not, the story of Anakin Skywalker's fall and redemption mirrors the deepest spiritual teachings about the nature of knowledge, power, and the eternal choice between light and darkness. Perhaps he picked up a few things from Joseph Campbell, whose work helped to inspire him along the construction of the story.

The back of Vader's chest plate was inscribed with Hebrew letters.

Yoda = Wise little green jedi
In Hebrew, "yada" (יָדַע) means "to know." Yaw-dah

Essentially, "yada" is the action of knowing, and "da'at" is the result or state of knowing.
Da'at is a noun that is actually derived from the verb "yada"

Anak-kin
In Judaism, the Anakim were a race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament. 
These were the offspring of the fallen angels who mated with women.
Nephilim - 100% angel
Anakim - 50% angel, 50% human
Rephaim - 25% angel, 75% human

![GormoTrainingYoda.jpeg](/img/user/images/GormoTrainingYoda.jpeg)

The one who taught Yoda was supposedly a giant serpentine being. 
The messiah in Judaism is supposedly linked very closely to this serpentine energy.
The word for messiah in Hebrew has the same gematria value as the word serpentine. 


![daath-body.png](/img/user/images/daath-body.png)

Da'at, when superimposed over the body of man
is located at the area of the throat.
Spoken into existence is the premise of the
Jewish, Christian, Egyptian, Hindu, and Mayan religions(+much more).
Creation occurs through Da'at.
So too, however, does destruction.
It is the way of life, and the way of death. 

Evil = devolving forces, descending, harmful
Good = that which elevates the spirit

Da'at is more complex as it encompasses both, and exists beyond the duality of good and bad. The science of da'at is the razor's edge, it is something very delicate. 

In ancient times, throughout the centuries, teachings that would bring one to this state were often hidden. One has to come to a place in life where they make the decision to search for themselves independently. You would have to become a dedicated student of some sort of path, and earn your way to Da'at. Even here, it is not a guarantee. We cannot truly grasp things until we awaken, observing consciously whatever teachings we have digested to the point we understand what they actually mean. The accumulation of these observations, the way they are integrated, that is all Da'at. This knowledge is beyond belief or theory: it is direct knowing through experience. 

Da'at is also the Hebrew equivalent for the word gnosis. 

Heard of the Gnostics? A bit of an umbrella term, there are many contrasting sects, but the general premise of the cosmology is artistically demonstrated through the movie The Matrix. Another branch of Christianity that was around in its early days, Gnostic Christians had a completely different perspective on the way reality was structured. It was different, that they were eventually to be seen as heretical and even evil by mainstream Christianity. From the lens of the Matrix, Da'at is what is gained from taking the red pill, Neo's awareness of the system he is in. The Tree of Knowledge, which Da'at represents, is actually not evil in the Gnostic worldview. The snake that comes to convince Adam and Eve to taste the delicate and delicious forbidden fruit, he's actually the good guy(Morpheus/Christ). They're all of a sudden aware that they have been unknowingly trapped in a material reality, asleep. This knowledge they are equipped with, gnosis, from the Tree of Knowledge, Da'at, allows for them to 'wake up' and see their condition as it really is, connecting them with truth. What was made forbidden, this knowledge of good and evil, was done so by the creator of the material world, the Demiurge/Yaldabaoth, or who in the matrix we see as, the "architect". The best prison is one in which the prisoners do not know they are in prison. Better yet, if you can convince them that leaving the prison is forbidden, even though they are all innocent and the front door is unlocked, well, you've made your job as a warden quite easy. Anyone that tries to inform the others, you can point to and call a lunatic... give em a little trip over to solitary. You can send one of your henchman, the demonic rulers of the material world, each associated with a different celestial sphere linked to the seven classical planets, called _archons_(Smith agents), to go and cause some ruckus in their lives and dissipate the cause. Their job is to prevent souls from leaving the material realm, this is their livelihood. You could bet your bottom dollar they're good at it! The energy of the soul is extracted from the occupants of this prison, and they supply the whole operation like batteries, what we see in the Matrix represented by the pods. Gnostics believed we are all originally innocent sparks of the divine, trapped in this creation of the Yaldabaoth, the physical body, and a cycle of reincarnation which keeps us in Hotel California. Da'at is what allowed for Neo to unplug himself, and Gnosis - another word for Da'at, aka wisdom/knowledge, this is what the Gnostics use to escape the hellscape they believe themselves to be in.

Erev Rav, עֵרֶב רַב ,  has a gematria value of 474.

![Pasted image 20250626223157.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250626223157.png)

The most famous Kabbalist of the day was _Rabbi Isaac Luria_ (1534-1572), universally known as the Arizal. He found it noteworthy to point out the gematria of Da'at, 474, being equivalent to Erev Rav. The Erev Rav were a group of mischiefs that snuck their way in with the people of Israel as they were fleeing Egypt. The word Erev Rav translates to "mixed multitude" and is a take on the corruption found within the Jewish people. Inside of the Zohar (I, 25a) it states that the Erev Rav will be particularly strong in the End of Days. It's at this point we will see them deploy their final all-in attempts to corrupt the world and lead people astray from the truth. 


Nero Caesar, the emperor of Rome from 54-68 AD, was often equated with the antichrist. Nero’s hatred of religion and superstition was written about by Suetonius. In addition, we know that Nero was disliked by the Jews, as it was under his reign the the Jewish Revolt of 66-73 AD began. He initiated the first state-sponsored persecution of Christians in Rome, likely beginning around 64 AD, following the Great Fire of Rome. In the journal of Tacitus it was said that he blamed Christians for the fire and used them as scapegoats, leading to brutal executions. When you take his name and translate it into Hebrew, you get נרון קסר .

The gematria system did not have much prevalence at the time of his rule, but even so, during his time he was viewed as a wicked man. Some argued that the Book of Revelation intends Nero as the antichrist figure.

In messing around trying to find words with exact gematrical equivalence to my own name, I found a word that was vaguely familiar.

Alright what the fuck

In 41 AD, Seneca was exiled to the island of Corsica. He was allowed to return in 49 AD to become a tutor for the next in line, Nero. Five years later, when he became emperor in 54AD, Seneca became Nero's advisor. Together with Sextus Afranius Burrus, appointed praetorian prefect, the two essentially acted as the government for the first five years of Nero's reign. After Burrus's death in 62AD, Seneca's influence declined quite fast. Tacitus wrote in his book _The Annals_, "the death of Burrus broke Seneca's power." He tried to retire twice, once in 62AD, and again in 64AD, but Nero refused. Even then he was not as present in court. In 65AD Seneca was thought to be a part of a conspiracy to kill Nero, and forced to commit suicide. It is likely that he was innocent, but, nevertheless, he agreed to end himself in a calm stoic manner.

![Nefertiti - verdens smukkeste kvinde.jpeg](/img/user/images/Nefertiti%20-%20verdens%20smukkeste%20kvinde.jpeg)

“Life-sized painted bust of the queen, 47 cm high. With the flat-cut blue wig, which also has a ribbon wrapped around it halfway up. Colours as if paint was just applied. Work absolutely exceptional. Description is useless, must be seen. Counterpart to the bust of the king from p. 39. Only the ears and part of the right side of the wig damaged.”

This quote from the 1912 excavation diary is the first known description of the bust of Nefertiti. It was written by Ludwig Borchardt, who led the excavation at Tell el-Amarna, and has been famously cited because of the passage: “Description is useless, must be seen”.
