The goal of this website is not to become rich, famous, or develop a new cult religion.
That would all be fun. 
Not sure if the person speaking could pull it off, 
but if it was achieved,
I think an 80foot statue of myself would be kind of cool. 

The goal here is the search for truth.
Or at-least the attempt, best efforts. 

My ultimate aim has been to bring the entity paradigm, what I personally perceive as very real, yet incredibly complex and subtle, to the forefront of our minds. As-well, not only that, there is a plethora of integration between science, spirituality, and philosophy that I believe can begin to take place. I want to translate New Earth material for the average man. Hey, you don't have to hop on board with me if you don't want to. I am not claiming every word to come out of my mouth as divine messages of truth, and I could very well be wrong. However....... what if I was right? 

After an extensive amount of investigation into these matters, 
I believe that I can say - this is a real factor within our reality. 
However, this is my opinion. A theory. Just a hypothesis.
The task, is to give breadth and depth to the subject.
I am not a clinically trained professional mental health expert.
I do not claim this, nor do I desire to proposition myself above this domain. 

All I have is one insight. 
An idea that began to obsess my days before [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]].
It's not even necessarily new or unique.
I am not the first to say or see these things.
It has existed since the days of the antiquity in different forms. 

Let us look into the development of our understanding of medicine. We should know that the history of the past holds specific relevance for today, carrying important messages. 
 
It is my belief that this could help to spark a new era of psychotherapy, but even more importantly,  a new understanding of ourselves. It will likely take years and years of _further_ work, both on myself, and in study, to get to something that may be able to enter into the discussion with any sort of potential merit. 

The Complex Integration of Multiple Brain Systems ([[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/CIMBS\|CIMBS]]) paradigm in combination with an understanding of brain systems ([[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/Archaeology of Mind\|Archaeology of Mind]]) ... then paired with Kundalini/Kriya yoga practice, where one could complexly integrate things, I believe, is the ticket. This would allow for someone to sit first person in their 'body-vehicle,' with an understanding of the different elements which contribute to its functioning, and optimize their unique biological machinery from the inside. Through prompting the mind with directed focus, and pairing this with techniques, one would be able to follow a path that is both scientific and spiritual. The soul - first person VR suit - overcoming maladaptive hardware with advanced insight on its internal parts, making the process much easier and simple, less painful, difficult, and confusing. That is really what I hope to put together here for others. Some sort of iOSelf. 

What I found notable in studying [[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/Archaeology of Mind\|Archaeology of Mind]], was that when different systems within the brain are unhealthy, they are often oriented in a manner that is towards the serving of the self. This reminded me of [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] which discusses how the negative polarity is oriented towards serving oneself. Each individual is set to make a free-will choice between two primary polarities: **service to others** (STO) and **service to self** (STS). I believe that when people are in the STS frame, perhaps they are in a sense, stuck in an unhealthy brain. Maybe some elements of this include the influence of your inherited karma and was part of the souls evolution, and perhaps other aspects are related to negative entity influences. The internal decision to be STO, in some way or capacity, may be akin to the desire to have a healthy brain, or act as a form of self-exorcism. The spiritual decision gives rise to the opportunity for one to find some sort of path which forges itself upon their way, allowing that healing process to take place, and for the brain to feel good again, and heal its systems. Perhaps this is the 'holy spirit' which comes in and guides the optimal way to complexly integrate everything naturally as you simply engage with life from a place of stillness that can find the path of inner guidance.

Ignaz, "fiery one" or "_burning one_."
German form of the Latin "Ignatius," 
derived from "Ignis," the Latin word for "fire."

Ignaz Semmelweis was born on 1-7-1818 in Taban, an old area of Buda-(pest), what is modern Hungaray. Growing up, he was ostracized in school for disrupting the class by constantly asking too. many. questions. This didn't stop his desire to learn, and Ignaz proceeded to leave his home and attend higher educational studies in Vienna. First he was in school to learn law, but after a short-while, just a year, he made the transition into studying medicine. In 1844, Ignaz graduated, acquiring a degree from the university. He then proceeded to apply for a position in internal medicine at a clinic, facing bitter disappointment when he was rejected. This caused him to alter the sails upon his boat, and to specialize his knowledge further within the field of obstetrics. This is the medical specialty focused on the care of women during pre-conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and the immediate postpartum period. It is the 'OB,' of 'OBGYN,' where Ignaz obtained a MoM degree(Master of Midwifery). 

In July of 1846, Ignaz was appointed assistant to Professor Johann Klein in the first obstetrical clinic of the Vienna General Hospital, what in modern day terms, would be Chief-Resident. He became an obstetrician at the Vienna maternity/labor and delivery clinic and was trying to solve the enigma of puerperal, or childbirth fever. There were actually two clinics in this location. Around 10% of his clinic’s maternal patients died from postnatal complications. Puzzlingly, in the other Vienna Hospital Obstetrical Clinic, set up for the teaching of midwives, the mortality rate was under 3.5%. Patients desperately begged (for their life) to be admitted to this second clinic, some even on their knees, as anecdotally reported.

![Pasted image 20251111020841.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251111020841.png)

Women even began to purposefully give birth in the streets, pretending for the event to have begun occurring, accidentally, en route to the hospital, all so they could avoid being admitted to the first clinic. This actually seemed to work in their favor. Ignaz was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare amongst women choosing to give street births, over the 'professional setting', where the risk of infection, complications, and death, were substantially higher. These circumstances all began prompting his mind with a curiosity as to what was occurring here. 

Shortly after Ignaz's Vienna career began, in 1847, a close friend of his died from a cut sustained during an autopsy lecture. A student accidentally hit him with the knife while they were working. This post-mortem poke occurred while Ignaz was on an 18 day vacation in Venice, getting fresh air, and escaping the horrors of the maternity ward which were haunting him. He came back to this unfortunate news. It was tragic, but an inspirational event that led to the discovery of the next puzzle piece. To pull from his own writing...

_The Etiology_
	"I was immediately overwhelmed by the sad news that Professor Jakob Kolletschka, whom I greatly admired, had died in the interim.  
	The case history went as follows: Kolletschka, Professor of Forensic Medicine, often conducted autopsies for legal purposes in the company of students. During one such exercise, his finger was pricked by a student with the same knife that was being used in the autopsy. I do not recall which finger was cut. Professor Kolletschka contracted lympha....    ((I'll save you some reading))
	I was still animated by the art treasures of Venice, but the news of Kolletschka's death agitated me still more. In this excited condition I could see clearly that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many hundred maternity patients had also died. The maternity patients also had lymphangitis, peritonitis, pericarditis, pleurisy, and meningitis, and metastases also formed in many of them. Day and night I was haunted by the image of Kolletschka's disease and was forced to recognize, ever more decisively, that the disease from which Kolletschka died was identical to that from which so many maternity patients died."


![Pasted image 20251111013259.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251111013259.png)

Semmelweis had an idea that the doctors were carrying infectious material from corpses into the delivery rooms on their unwashed hands. It was common practice for male obstetricians in training within the First Clinic to perform bare-handed autopsies early in the morning, including Semmelweis himself. Autopsies were never done by female student midwives from the Second Clinic. Including Semmelweis, coming immediately from the morgue with hands smelling of the cadavers being autopsied, the male obstetricians would then carry out examinations on women present in the First Clinic. This event with Jakob Kolletschka was what made it all clear. They did not know about germs at this time, and were unaware that they were transferring deadly infections from the room of death, to the rooms of life.

William Sinclair in 1909 - _Semmelweis: His Life and his Doctrine_
	"Now, in the autumn of 1847, was the Discovery of Semmelweis complete, and the Doctrine firmly established in his own mind. It amounted to this: that puerperal fever was caused by a decomposed animal organic matter conveyed by contact to the pregnant, parturient in labor, or puerperal post-birth woman without regard to its origin, whether from the cadaver or from a living person affected with a disease which produced a decomposed animal organic matter." (p. 61)

Chlorine hand washing became the standard way that Ignatz tackled the problem.

"The result was that the mortality rate in the First Clinic dropped 90%, and was then comparable to that in the Second Clinic. The mortality rate in April 1847 "((4-47))" was 18.3%. After hand washing was instituted in mid-May, the rates in June were 2.2%, July 1.2%, August 1.9% and, for the first time since the introduction of anatomical orientation, the death rate was zero in two months of the year following this discovery"
	https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3881728/pdf/jtgga-14-01-35.pdf

Semmelweis’s observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time. Unfortunately, the head of the department, Johann Klein, was a bit of conservative gentleman. He wanted to have doctors adhere to the strict medical orthodoxies that had already been established in previous practice, and some found it offensive that they were perceived as 'dirty.' The two of them argued incessantly over the subject of childbed fever. What was the implication here that Klein was not willing to accept? As a doctor, this implied that he himself as a medical practitioner had been ill-serving his patients, essentially murdering them. He attributed the decrease in mortality rates in Semmelweis's ward to a new ventilation system which had been installed. Many other doctors resented him as-well, they found his conclusions insulting. In 1849, when Ignatz'z apprenticeship was coming to its renewal, Klein refused to approve of the typical 2 year extension, leaving the young man without a job.

Semmelweis experienced turbulent times after announcing his hand washing protocol and emphasizing the importance of cleanliness to the medical community. His claims were thought to lack a scientific basis, and since he could offer no acceptable explanation for his findings, Ignatz was left frustratingly emptyhanded. Such a scientific explanation was only made possible some decades later, when Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and others, developed the germ theory of disease. 

Thankfully, by this point, Semmelweis had gain some allies in the medical department, particularly amongst the younger set. They urged him to continue in his efforts and conduct some experiments to strengthen the case. He could write his findings up in a book that would spread the theory throughout Europe. Semmelweis, however, had a flaw in his character. He could not turn his attention away from the battle with the man he apprenticed under, Klein. His blindness to the truth angered him, especially given the fact he had so much power in the field, viewing it almost as criminal. Why is it that Semmelweis would have to take so much of his time to go and conduct experiments and write books, when the truth was right there in their face, already so apparent? 

Ignatz petitioned the Viennese authorities for a position as Privat-Dozent, which would allow for him to teach students as a private lecturer, and gain access to some of the university facilities. Because of the ordeal with Klein, he was initially declined, but 18 months later, after another application, he was accepted. Doctors from all over Europe came and attended his lectures, which were 'fiery,' and filled with scorn towards the closed-mindedness of so many in the profession. Some were skeptical, but he also won over many to his cause. The University pressed him to continue the momentum, but within a few months of lectures, he went back to his home city of Buda-pest. Semmelweis himself adamantly refused to publish any account of his work. Because only second-hand accounts of his studies, and the recommendation of antiseptic chlorine washing remained, it was generally misunderstood, or dismissed as implausible - just plain wrong. Some of his friends had felt abandoned, staking their reputations on supporting Ignatz, only to be left forsaken. 

Here in Budapest, Ignatz found the medical career he was unable to secure in Vienna. The first position he held was as an unpaid director of the obstetrical ward at St. Rokus Hospital. He stayed here for six years until 1857, also acquiring a position in 1855 as Professor of Theoretical and Practical Obstetrics at the University of Pest. As to be expected, at the hospital, he imposed a chlorinated hand washing regimen. This produced a low number of puerperal fever deaths during the six-year period (8 out of 933 births for a mortality rate of 0.86%), but, the way he did it was filled with such rigor and tyrannical intensity, that he alienated almost all of the doctors and nurses he worked with. No matter how well intentioned he was, his tone seemed to turn more and more people against him. What he had done, was force upon everyone his novel ideas on disinfection, but without any of the proper evidence to back up and support his claims. It seemed to them that this guy was just out here promoting himself, obsessed with his own creation. His vehement insistence that this was the truth seemed to only call more careful attention to the lack of grounded scholarly research. Ultimately, he went mad, writing violent letters all over the place.

Eventually, beginning in the fall of 1857, after enough pressure from his colleagues, and despite an aversion to writing, Ignatz decided to divulge his theory into a book. By the time he had finished, what should have been a simple and small volume had ballooned into a massive 600 page encyclopedia - incredibly difficult to read.  The reviews were highly negative. He was repetitive, hopelessly convoluted, and would constantly divert his arguments into 'worthy' attacks on the doctors whom had opposed him, and were therefore murderers. 

From a letter he wrote to William Scanzoni, the director of the obstetrical clinic in Prague
	"... and in this matter, Herr Hofrath, you have sent all over Germany a considerable contingent of practitioners who will, in their ignorance, engage in homicidal practices. ... Your teaching, Herr Hofrath, is based upon the dead bodies of lying-in women slaughtered through ignorance; and ... I have formed the unshakeable resolution to put an end to this murderous work as far as [it] lies in my power to do so. ... If, however, Herr Hofrath, without having discussed my Doctrine as an opponent, you go on to write ... in support of the doctrine of epidemic puerperal fever, to teach your students the doctrine of epidemic puerperal fever, I denounce you before God and the world as a murderer, and the History of Puerperal Fever will not do you an injustice when, for the service of having been the first to oppose my life-saving Lehre [,] it perpetuates your name as a medical Nero."

All of a sudden criticism crept in. Ignatz committed to a process of writing, but had done such a poor job at doing so, that others could easily poke holes in his arguments. Even something as simple as calling attention to his aggressive tone did the trick, and his former allies did not accompany the cause. They hated him, and his behavior at the hospital became so erratic, that employers were forced to release him. In his book you can see the early signs of a self-destructive messianic complex, almost apocalyptic in stylization. Those around him, including his wife, presumed that he was losing his mind. In 1865, nearly 20 years after the initial breakthrough in 1847, he was committed to the Landesirrenanstalt Döbling (provincial lunatic asylum). His wife had lured him to the location with the assistance of an old colleague, under the pretext of touring a new facility. It was here, over the cuckoos nest, that he died of septic shock only 14 days later. This proceeded in a manner similar to his friend, with an infectious cut on hand. Another possible source of Ignatz's death may have been a severe beating from guards after trying to escape early on.

He was 47 years old. 

_The Etiology_
	"The object of this essay is this: to present historically to the medical instructor observations that I made at this clinic in this period, to demonstrate how I began to doubt existing teachings concerning the origin and the concept of childbed fever, and how I was irresistibly forced to my present conviction, in order that he also, for the welfare of mankind, may derive the same convictions. By nature I am averse to all polemics. This is proven by my having left numerous attacks unanswered. I believed that I could leave it to time to break a path for the truth. However, for thirteen years my expectations have not been fulfilled to the degree that is essential for the well-being of mankind. An additional misfortune was that in the school years of 1856–57 and 1857–58, maternity patients died in such numbers at my own obstetrical clinic in Pest that my opponents could use these deaths as evidence against me. It must be shown that these two unfortunate years provide tragic and unintentional yet direct confirmation of my views. To my aversion to all polemics must be added my innate aversion to every form of writing. Fate has chosen me as the representative of those truths that are laid down in this essay. It is my inescapable obligation to support them. I have given up the hope that the importance and the truth of the matter would make all controversy unnecessary. Rather than my inclinations, people’s lives must be considered, people who do not even participate in the conflict over whether my opponents or I have the truth. Since silence has proven futile, I must forcibly restrain my inclinations and step once more before the public as though uncautioned by the many bitter hours I have endured. I have made the best of these hours; for those yet to come I find consolation in knowing that I advocate only that which is firmly grounded in my own convictions. 84 Pest, 30 August 1860 (pp. 61–62)

	"After several long trips to India, he wrote a thesis for a Doctorate of Medicine on the topic of chakras and subtle bodies in the Hindu tradition. For this voluminous work, supported by original Sanskrit translations, he was not only awarded the title of Doctor of Medicine but also a silver medal (2nd highest possible award for a medical thesis in France), and the title of 'faculty prize-winner'. He was elected to the French Society of History of Medicine."

The idea of Luciferic (trying to go straight to the heights of Spirituality inappropriately) vs Ahrimanic forces (pure materialism completely separated from Spirituality whatsoever aka Western Science) by Rudolf Steiner is something that I spent a very long time with a while back. Months and months of observing reality through this frame, it seems to be quite on point. Absolutely eye opening.

[27] As he was saying this to me, Poimandres joined with the powers. Then he sent me forth, empowered and instructed on the nature of the universe and on the supreme vision, after I had given thanks to the father of all and praised him. And I began proclaiming to mankind the beauty of reverence and knowledge: "People, earthborn men, you who have surrendered yourselves to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of god, make yourselves sober and end your drunken sickness, for you are bewitched in unreasoning sleep." [28] When they heard, they gathered round with one accord. And I said, "Why have you surrendered yourselves to death, earthborn men, since you have the right to share in immortality? You who have journeyed with error, who have partnered with ignorance, think again: escape the shadowy light; leave corruption behind and take a share in immortality." [29] Some of them, who had surrendered themselves to the way of death, resumed their mocking and withdrew, while those who desired to be taught cast themselves at my feet. Having made them rise, I became guide to my race, teaching them the words - how to be saved and in what manner - and I sowed the words of wisdom among them, and they were nourished from the ambrosial water.
