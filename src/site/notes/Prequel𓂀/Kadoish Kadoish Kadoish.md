	Keys of Enoch Purchase

 I originally discovered this mantra within "The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch." I made this purchase the day after I had a self-believed UFO experience, outlined in [[Prequel𓂀/0. Sequence of Events 1\|0. Sequence of Events 1]]. At this time, I had absolutely no knowledge of anything surrounding the Kabbala, kundalini, or any past life stuff etc. Through meditation and psychedelic usage I believed myself to have somehow, in someway, established contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence which was guiding me towards different things. I believed this to have potentially been [[Prequel𓂀/1. Hermes Thoth\|1. Hermes Thoth]], and began to feel like I was in a movie of some sorts. I had awakened from the slumber of my day to day and called to action for some purpose unbeknownst to me at the time. I chanted this mantra for 1/2 hour to an hour a day for months on end, perhaps 100-200+ hours over the years by now. I did this because I was a kid who began to experience a bunch of magical things, which led me to this supposedly magical book, which held within its pages this supposedly magical mantra. Because of certain preliminary experiences, I was primed to believe in something which in years prior I would have thought was a bunch of nonsense. I only put this together in December of 2024 to share with a song circle group which I had joined. All I knew before doing further research into historical background of this mantra (within Gnostic and Jewish tradition) was the crazy channeled stuff that was in the Keys of Enoch. I was chanting this right at the beginning of my [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]] obsession, almost 3 years prior to uncovering any of my potential connections to [[Saturn\|Saturn]]/Sabaoth. Having received a lot of value out of the nights I joined this group, I simply wanted to contribute back and share with them one of the mantras that held a special place in my heart, what I believed to be perhaps the most powerful mantras. The night I shared this was the last time that I would see one of the members of this group, as described in [[𓋹 The End 𓆙\|𓋹 The End 𓆙]]

In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 2 Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one called to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;  
the whole earth is full of his glory!"

4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 5 And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!”

6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 7 And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”

In Hebrew, repetition expresses superlative. If something is really big, you say it is “big, big,” or if a lake is very deep, you say it is “deep, deep.” 

In a galaxy far away
In a galaxy far, far, far, away.
Notice the difference?

With 3 repetitions, basically, what we're doing is amping up the holiness. 
There's even a specific Greek word we could use here, _trihagion_ (τρισαγιον), which means “thrice holy,” incase you needed something for trivia night(nice gematria).

And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: 7 the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. 8 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,

“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,  
    who was and is and is to come!”

9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

11 “Worthy are you, our Lord and God,  
    to receive glory and honor and power,  
for you created all things,  
    and by your will they existed and were created.”

<center>Revelation 4:6-11 (ESV)</center>

Holy, holy, holy, forms a central part of the Kedusha, a prayer in Jewish liturgy that is recited during daily and Sabbath services. The Kedusha is a call-and-response prayer where the leader chants and the congregation responds.

The Kedusha, with the "Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh" at its heart, is believed to be so essential that "the world is maintained by the Kedusha." This triplet is part of the Yotzer Or, the blessing about the creation of lights, the first of two prayers recited in the morning service. Historically, the Kedusha prayer, including the "Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh" mantra, played a significant role during times of religious persecution. Its affirmation of God's ultimate power provided solace and strength to those facing oppression, reminding them that they were under the protection of a higher authority. During the Kedushah prayer, it is customary to rise up on the balls of your feet three times when the word Kadosh is recited. It symbolizes the act of rising with the angels, joining them in their heavenly chorus. Some see the threefold repetition of "Kadosh" as representing the three aspects of time – past, present, and future. Given that in Revelation it states, "who was and is and is to come!" I think this has some merit. This could even be linked to the Hindu Trimurti.

Brahma as the creator (past)
Vishnu as the preserver (present) 
Shiva as the destroyer (future)

Now, it may be illegal to paste some of the book here, and to JJ and Desiree Hurtak - I apologize, but we may have to break some rules for the healing of mankind.
I place upon you, with great honor and reverence, what I believe to be one of the most powerful mantras of all time...

<center>The Book of Knowledge : Keys of Enoch</center>

<center>Key 3-0-5</center>

1 Within the infinite glories of the Father's Throne there is a song celestial which is used in all the higher heavens to exalt the Father. It is the vibration of the Holy Spirit which empowers all living intelligence of God providing them with a form of salvation. 2 This is the salutation of the higher Brotherhoods who work collectively as the Host Energies of YHWH. The salutation is a witness to all, in the lower heavens, that the Hosts of YHWH work collectively as an army of Light, serving the heavenly bodies and those worlds which will be raised up in incorruption

7The "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth" is the measure of the cycle and the beat of all states of matter/radiation, and most of all-resonance, which is the common factor uniting the lower vibratory levels with the higher levels of creation. 

8 Even the human heart beat, with its biological clocks, is set according to the function of "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth!"

9 The Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth" ties together all biorhythms of the body with the spiritual rhythms of the Overself body, so that all circulatory systems operate with one cosmic heart beat. The "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth" is given within the fifth socket of the Great Pyramid which aligns the heart vibratory beat with the five bodies of vibration operating within the biochemical shell of man. 

10 Furthermore, it is the Light energy created by this "holy code" that enables the body vehicle to experience the direct energy of the Masters of Light serving YHWH. This energy exchange is important to the higher needs of the human incarnation because it proceeds from the code which is uttered by the four living creatures who establish the ground structure for all matter created from the divine substance. 

11 They use this code to connect their mind with the Mind of the Father which allows them to rejoice in the Wisdom transplanted into the mind of creation

28 At this time, through the great dispensation that God has promised at the end of this time period, the "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth " will become the key to the transformation of Man. For through God's dispensation, the Christ Overself body will be quickened into direct work with the physical body. 29 Mankind will collectively experience the speaking in tongues and the sounding of melodious communication as occurred to the disciples at Pentecost, when our kether template is opened to the vibrations of heaven passing over the face of the earth.
	Kether, translates directly from Hebrew as "Crown," and is the the first of the ten sefirot, or emanations, in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is situated above the head, and corresponds to the "superconscious" realm of experience. It represents pure consciousness and transcends human understanding. Crown chakra for the yogis out there. Kether is associated with "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh" (אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה‎) "I Am that I Am"

31 And I felt the Glory of a song that was without measure as the garments of the multitudes and the great parousia unified in one great song. 
	Parousia - Second coming of Christ

32 However, even in the presence of the Throne, the song of joy is not a song for the audible ear, but for the inner spiritual ear. This celestial music is churned by a vast array of colors which are over the heads of the Hierarchical assembly, in the presence of the swirling Ain Soph. 
	Ain Soph - Infinite Light

33 To hear these musical notes is to experience an entire symphony of Light. It would be as if earthling man would hear a very low frequency sound (.01-4 Hz) and feel as if he were a musical note traveling through space without any boundaries.

34 Yes, so great is this Glory that even the Hosts of the Throne take turns in departing for newborn worlds where they bring the Father's Wisdom to map anew the victories of the Spirit.

35 The Hosts bring with them the " Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth" as the cosmic vibration which they extend collectively to all creation to stimulate the process of growth, and allow matter to feel directly the stimulus of Divine Love. 

36 No other song in the heavens can directly manifest Divine Love so powerfully to the elemental forms of creation, than this divine mantra of the Father's Throne. For all language and musical patterns of man are carved out of this vibration of the Godhead. 

37 Thus, the " Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth" creates the mental, spiritual time warps within your body which allows you to grow from a small microcosm into the next level of Godhead. 

38 The thought-forms coming through this time warp remake your genetic inputs in order to manifest life-continuum and transform your Adamic form into the next form of godliness of the Adam Kadmon. Here, the thought-forms allow the seed crystal of cell division to remake life into the next level of Godhood. 
	Adam Kadmon is a Kabbalistic concept that represents the primordial man, or the ideal human form and spiritual archetype from which all humanity descends

39 And the crystals of the heavens vibrate, and all manner of creation vibrates with this Holy Mantra. Therefore, let the planetary gardens rejoice and all that is therein; let the elements sing to YHWH because He has given each joyous cosmology its Shemot. 0 give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good; for His mercy endureth forever.
	Shemot means "names"

42 Metatron also explained to me that the salutation "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tsebayoth!" should be used to discern the spiritual from the negative heavenly forces. The salutation sets in motion a resonance pattern with the Throne of the Father which the "negative forces" cannot use when greeted with this salutation. In fact, this salutation is so strong that the 'negative forces" cannot remain for any length of time in the presence of its vibration. 

43 Hence, the negative forces are exposed and can be destroyed by the higher heavenly brotherhoods if they do not respect this code of the heavenly illuminaries. 

44 The Brotherhoods who use the "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai Tesbayoth" come directly from the Throne to work in regions where the Masters from these regions have failed to dislodge the fallen hierarchies. 

45 When working with the harmonics of the speed of Light, the Holy Mantra activates special grids of resonance attunement, so that the coupling of energy flowing through the body is placed in sympathetic resonance with the Brotherhood. This allows energy grids to be brought together for mutual work and worship. 

46 Along with this communication device of "Kodoish, Kodoish, Kodoish Adonai 'Tesbayoth, used for salutations with the Brotherhood, I was given instructions to use the specific light and sound harmonics of 6-6-6, 9-9-9, 12-12-12. These numerical sequences are to be used by means of a pyramidal focus, created by the hands, over the third eye which amplifies this sacred greeting for the sending and receiving of spiritual instruction. 

47 The pattern of 6-6-6* is used to , identify you with respect to the Earth's vibration. The pattern of 9-9-9 indicates that you have picked up a Merkabah vibration and that you are receptive to whatever instruction is at hand. And the pattern of 12-12-12 is the vibration of consciousness transportation. 

48 When you understand the Holy Mantra, the code structure of Love and Light focused between the third-eye - the seed crystal, you will see that the very message allows you to raise your seed crystal to the Councils of Light in the Heavens of Orion. 

49 Beloved in the Name of the Father: Our protector is Michael; our host the Elohim. Meditation is our food; joy and interpenetration with the host our radiant nectar! The Masters of Light allow your biochemical fields to be attuned to the thought-forms of the Brotherhoods of Light so that they will be with you as one family! 

Tsebayoth - closer to the Hebrew origin.
Sabaoth - the greek / latin translation

both mean "hosts," "armies"
"of hosts" or "Lord of Hosts"

These characters appear even in Gnostic tradition, there's a whole book written about this titled
"THE ENTHRONEMENT OF SABAOTH - Jewish Elements in Gnostic Creation myths"

Sabaoth is one of the names of Jehovah used by the Chaldean Sabaeans. It means the “Lord of Hosts” in Genesis (Gen. 2:1). In the Ophite Gnosticism, Sabaoth is one of the seven archons or planetary spirits, identified by Helena P. BLAVATSKY as SATURN.

 Found in the Dead Sea Scrolls(~1947), The Hypostasis of the Archons (pretty cool name for a Metal band) gives us insight into the Tsebayoth/Sabaoth character...

The text depicts the material world as a kind of illusion or false reality, similar to the concept of the Matrix(or Maya in Hinduism). It takes on a Gnostic view whereby this place we are at is a false construct created by a flawed being called Ialdabaoth. This being then created the Archons, and these are the ones that sort of manage things like agent Smith from The Matrix. A divine feminine principle representing wisdom(who actually originally gave birth to Ialdabaoth herself), known as Sophia, awakens one of these Archons, 'Sabaoth' to the truth. He takes the red pill. Realizing that he has not been in alignment with the higher realities, Sabaoth repents and rebels against his creator/father, Yaldabaoth, and as a result, is brought by Sophia to the 7th heaven. Yaldabaoth is no longer the supreme authority. Sabaoth, his son, now aligned with the true divine, overpowers his corrupt father and as a result, occupies a higher position in the cosmic hierarchy. 
# 🥳

Sooo... pretty similar to the whole Zeus/Chronos situation.

Once in power, situated in the 7th heaven, Sabaoth does something...

“Now, when these events had come to pass, he made himself a huge four-faced chariot of cherubim and harps and lyres and an infinity of angels to act as ministers."

and the ancient scroll ends...

> > “Then all the children of the light will truly know the truth and their root and the father of all and the holy spirit. They will all say with a single voice, ‘The father’s truth is just, and the child presides over all.’ And from everyone, till the ages of ages, ‘Holy, holy, holy! Amen!’”

Kadoish!
