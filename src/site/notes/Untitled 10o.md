On November 6th, Nancy Pelosi, the first and only female speaker of the US House of Representatives, has announced that she will not seek reelection. Nancy has been one of the most powerful figures in Democratic politics for decades, and first stepped into office as a mother of 5 when she was 47 years old. The year was 1987. Representative Sala Burton was dying of colon cancer when she called up her friend, knowing that time was short, inspiring her to take the seat. Four of Nancy's children had already gone off to college. Her youngest, a daughter named Alexandra, was just becoming a senior in Highschool. In her book, "Know Your Power: A Message to America's Daughters," she reflects "I'll never forget the first time I saw the Capitol. It was on a cold January day in 1947, when I was 6 years old. ... I saw a stunning building with a magnificent white dome. I still think it's the most beautiful building in the world because of what it represents: the voice of the people."

47 dogs and puppies were rescued from three properties suspected of dogfighting in South Carolina this week. Four people are in custody. Many of the dogs were chained, underweight, and fighting infections. Veterinarians have examined the animals, and they are being evaluated at a confidential location

Monkey 47 a premium dry gin coming from Germany's Black Forest, named for its 47 handpicked botanicals and its 47% alcohol by volume. At first glance, the bottle that holds Monkey 47 Schwarzwald Dry Gin looks as though it was lifted straight from a 19th-century apothecary shelf. Every element of its construction, from the dark glass, to the textured label, is designed to echo the craft and precision that define the spirit inside. The cork even comes tightly held by a silver ring which accompanies one's purchase. It features the Latin phrase "Ex Pluribus Unum" ("Out of many, one"), which reflects the gin's complex blend of 47 ingredients.

Speaking of black forest...

The Krusty Krab was named after a pet monkey that Julius Caesar had growing up in the Philippines. That was my favorite animal growing up, how cool. I remember him describing a story where this primate, Smacky, was trying to attack him, and he had to hide in an empty pool while it circled the perimeter.

I haven't been there in a while. Even so, the flavors of the past can't escape me. There have been days where all that can I can think about is ... how on the first Wednesday of every month, there is a profoundly delicious pepperoncini pickled egg salad sandwich that is curated. It is the product of a very elaborate flavorful procedure. Eggs are hardboiled and then peeled from the habitation of their shells. These are then delicately placed into reservoirs of pepperoncini juice. For the next 30 days, the flavor soaks in. Afterwards, a complex seasoning sequence is applied to this fowl product... but the result is anything but foul. Tastebuds begin to explode once you sink your teeth into the hoagie bun. All of a sudden you are walking down a yellow brick mustard road. A slight overlay of green onion warms the heart center. Layers of ham, in their noun form, begin going ham, in the verbal form. The bacon, crispy pieces of bacon - they are layered like the feathers of a beautiful bald eagle, your ticket to freedom, like a cherry on top. There were a plethora of excited ritualistic magicians would arrive on the scene and order 10+ of these at once for their staff. You have to get there early and on time, or you miss the boat. Be warned if you choose to enter this building, 

"No free smells, what the hell do we look like, Jimmy Johns??"

An old friend from middle school, it seems, has acquired a position in this location, employment wise. His birthday party many ago, in middle school, when GTA 5 had first came out, was quite fun. It does seem, however, that he has disconnected from the necessity of grooming oneself. The hair which sits upon his head is incredibly disheveled and rampant. There is great worry for him in my heart at this time. I pray that you find a barber and get yourself together. There was a psychic portal which opened for a brief moment upon first glance of this photograph, during which, I was able to see directly into his auric field.

I should take a moment to give the necessary respect to the rest of the crew, 
including Liv, 
Jen, 
and Eli. 

I can only imagine the horror they faced on a day to day basis after my departure...
(I think they started breaking all sorts of records)
