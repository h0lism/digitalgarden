After 15 years of clinical experimentation, Albert and Beatriz settled on five distinct conscious capabilities that realistically worked for them as therapists. There are sure to be others, but they found that when their patients had distinct access to each of these capabilities, their treatment would become more and more successful throughout each session.

They labeled these....
# The A Team

Awareness
	The _Awareness brain system_ is our conscious ability to mindfully observe our internal and external experiences. You can observe that your patient will be able to carefully reflect on and describe their authentic internal experience that is congruent with your observations. For example, "I am aware that I am safe and yet my body feels unsafe."

Attention
	The _Attention brain system_ is our ability to carefully and intentionally focus our conscious mind moment by moment. For example, your patient is able to mindfully direct their conscious focus toward their internal experience or any topic. For example, "I have many thoughts and feelings going through my mind; however, I am harnessing my attention to focus on myself right now."

Authority
	The _Authority brain system_ enables us to discern and be open to our own unique wants, desires, preferences, and choices. Your patient is able to speak spontaneously and strongly about their own truths and wants. For example, "I am feeling a pull to my usual worries, and it is important that I choose (spoken with emphasis) to step out of my comfort zone right now."

Autonomy
	The _Autonomy brain system_ enables us to experience ourselves as separate from other people, their expectations, and judgements. Your patient is readily able to speak up and assert their unique desires and override and tendency to please you or others. For example, "I know that I am used to meeting others' expectations, yet I have a right (said emphatically) to do what I want to do."

Agency
	The _Agency brain system_ refers to our ability to trust that we can make things happen in our life. Your patient becomes more animated as they express (embody) their desires. "I know it will be difficult to make these changes, and I trust in my own capability (said passionately) of following through to improve my life."


There is some overlap between these conscious brain systems as they can work in parallel, support, and sustain each other.
