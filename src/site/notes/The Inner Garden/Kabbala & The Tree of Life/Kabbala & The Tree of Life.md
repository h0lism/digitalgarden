Kabbala was kept secret sorta hush hush amongst the elites
but it eventually begins to be taught in public...
Why?
Because they think the world is coming to an end
The 1492 Alhambra Degree was the beginning of the end of the world and  in order to usher in the messiah, Kabbala began to be taught widespread. 

"By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible."


The Tree of Life 


The tree is made up of ten spiritual principles, or sefirot, that are united in a mystical state called Da'at. In Da'at, all sefirot are one, sharing and revealing the Divine Light.

The middle pillar of the tree symbolizes cosmic forces flowing invisibly beneath the surface - like sap flowing through its trunk and branches

"In brief, the Tree of Life is a compendium of science, psychology,
philosophy, and theology." — Dion Fortune


Kabbalah literally means “reception” or “receiving.”


The word Kabbalah is a feminine noun and comes from the Hebrew root Qof-Beit-Lamed (קבל), which means "to receive" or "to accept."

The creator is constantly giving. 
And giving at 100%, withholding nothing 
Why am I not receiving?
I don’t have the vessel
I don’t have the capacity 
There is negativity, blockages which are in the way - preventing us from receiving the beneficence that is always there - always present. 
Slowly  we come to the place where we can overcome ourselves.
Where we can overcome bad habit
Overcome our negative judgement
and make the blessings more constant.  

The word, Qabalah, originates from the Hebrew "QBL," meaning "an oral
tradition." The Qabalah is the esoteric component of Judaism, referred to
by Dion Fortune as the "Yoga of the West."


A person who studies Kabbalah is called a mekubal, which means "one who receives."

“My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”  
	- Nikola Tesla 
		see [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/Morphogenetic Fields\|Morphogenetic Fields]]


Within the tradition, 

We experience God as Shekinah, it’s feminine aspect. 




"For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to pure speech, that all of them may call upon the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord"
	Zephaniah 3:9 

In the Sefer Yetzirah(The Book of Formation), a foundational Kabbalistic text, it states that Being emerges from divine language. God used the 22 letters, along with the 10 _Sefirot_ (divine emanations), to create existence. The Hebrew letters are the DNA of the universe, the building blocks of reality. They are the physical representation of the divine energy intelligence that created everything, from the planets to the galaxies. Each month is represented by a sign of the zodiac, and by a planet, both created by a Hebrew letter. The Book of Formation explains that by meditating daily on the Hebrew letters specific to the month, you can influence how your month plays out. How one speaks becomes important. Because we hold the capacity for speech, if we speak correctly, we can bend reality to our will. We can see this near its upper bound within the concept of the golem. Perhaps you've heard of Frankenstein... The Sefer Yetzirah lays out a procedure by which one can bring to life an inanimate object. Rabbis were supposedly able to fashion and mold clay into a form, perform a ritual involving the recitation of divine names and specific letter combinations, and bring an object to life. This could be as a calf, a human being, birds, perhaps a gazelle, even plant life. In Midrash and Talmudic sources, Adam is initially created as a golem (גולם) when his dust is "kneaded into a shapeless husk," afterwards being fashioned into a body and then having the soul "breathed into him." No anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. 

Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, has a tradition of attributing significance to letters as-well. Ilm al-Huruf (عِلْم الْحُرُوف) (the science of letters), lays out the science of the special qualities of each of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, as well as their diverse qualities when combined with one another, similar to what is described in the Sepher Yetzirah. What is very interesting is that both the Arabic language and the Hebrew language start with alif/alef.

Bat-Kol (בת קול) Literally means "daughter of a voice" in Hebrew, and is generally manifested as a voice delivering a Divine message proclaiming God's will or judgment. It's a more indirect and less authoritative form of divine communication compared to prophecy, often being understood as an actual auditory phenomenon – a voice that could be heard. The _Bat Kol_ is sometimes described as an “echo” of the Divine voice, although the nature of the “echo” cannot be described in normal terms. Bat (בת) means daughter, while Kol (קול) translates to voice/sound, so the sound is not a direct voice from heaven; rather it is a voice that is derivative, heard indirectly, like an echo. One of the primary characteristics of the _Bat Kol_ is the invisibility of the speaker. A voice is heard and no man is seen, there is zero visual accompaniment. The nature of the audible quality of the _Bat Kol_ varies. Sometimes it is a quiet voice, in other moments it is a grand, reverberating, and booming voice. In some contexts the word “_bat kol_” was simply understood as “sound,” not originating in the created universe, but proceeding from God. It was sometimes regarded as being spoken by an angel, especially Gabriel(the divine messenger), and as such is the “echo” of God's communication. 





They would summon beings to teach you things rapidly 
-Downloading information 


Kabbalah describes angels as emissaries of divine will, each governing specific cosmic functions. Invoking them was not about "summoning" in a coercive sense but _attuning_ to their energy to receive guidance or protection.


Shattered Vessels

"The shattering of the vessels" (in Hebrew, "_Shevirat haKeilim_")

Isaac Luria believed that when God created the world, he did so by forming vessels to hold the Divine Light. The 10 _Sefirot_, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, were developed. As the light began to fill these vessels, there came a point where they were unable to contain all of the divinity... they shattered. Sparks of Divine light were trapped in the different shards of these vessels as they scattered throughout the cosmos and formed our world. The job which humanity is tasked to accomplish is reunite the scattered sparks of Light, to repair the broken world, and thus participate in finishing God’s work. 


According to Luria, the ten vessels that were originally meant to contain the emanation of God's light were unable to contain that light and were hence either displaced or shattered. As a result of this cosmic catastrophe, the Sefirot, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, are shattered and out of place, and the world within which we reside, is composed of the shards of the these broken values.

Luria's Kabbala was both a refusal and an extension of the reigning kabbalistic ideas during his time. His system is a fully developed, although not always coherent, analysis of the seder hishtalshelut, aka the order of development, or the order of evolution, as a spiraling cycle of hitpashtut (egression) and histallekut (regression). 

The heart of the system is this dialectical structure where everything is happening all at once, yet at the same time everything is also being erased. There is this constant movement to and fro where the world is on one hand becoming exiled, but simultaneously on the other, it is being redeemed. You don't know quite where you are in time and space. 




the system is so dynamic and it's it's almost like a fractal that the more you zoom in on a region of the fractal the

Tikkun Olam

ruach ha-kodesh

Tikkun Olam

Bhagavad Gita 15:1-5

The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.

The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.

The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.

One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.

"Thou art the tree of the world (whose roots extend upwards and branches hang downwards). Thou art the banian"
-Mahabarata (Page 1,950)


Odin's self-sacrifice. He sacrificed his eye in Mimir's well and he threw himself on his spear Gungnir in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then **hanged himself in Yggdrasil, the tree of life, for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes**.

Nathan of Gaza - The Tortured Soul of the Messiah

Plunged into the deepest depths of the Qlippoth, into the hellish torment of the parasitism at the
very abyss of non-existence lies the tortured soul of the Messiah, wrestling with the horrid Dragon of the depths. In some of the more extreme passages it appears that the soul of the Messiah even began as an aspect of this horrid Dragon of the depths, although Nathan of Gaza never seems to fully commit to this idea. 

the fuel upon which the parasitic qlippoth feed, being so far from the Divine Light these righteous souls are actually necessary for the Demonic husks to maintain any existence at all - plunged into the very abyss, near non-being, these bright sparks are like fuel cells which prevent the qlippoth from tattering off into pure non-existence

those settled into the depths of the tahiru could only be released from the
clutches of the qlippoth by an act of cunning or Divine trickery or fraud to trick the forces of evil into releasing those really righteous Souls

this was primarily done by the Divine destining those souls to undergo or commit a deed in their life so awful or morally outrageous that the forces of the qlippoth thought that that this would actually allow them to both feed off of them in this primeval period but also because such horrible deeds will eventually be committed they could also recapture these various powerful souls and thus return them to the depths of the Abyss having committed such Dreadful misdeeds to feed on them forever

However

Engagement with the Qlippoth (evil forces) was actually a divine plan to redeem(Tikkun) the trapped sparks, thereby tricking the Qlippoth into allowing their own undoing.

Resolution of evil into good through the process of redemption

The Messiah’s apparent transgressions were reinterpreted as sacred actions, necessary to dismantle evil from within. 

Minor sins relatively speaking would be overcome by a huger Arc of redemption the Divine had planned - hese apparent sins would actually allow these very powerful Souls a kind of escape velocity from the forces of the qlippoth by engaging in a higher degree of Redemptive work

the talmud has it the more righteous a person is the more tortured by sin they are

 struggling with the worst of the forces of the qlippoth would eventually emerge from those depths but the clepotic influence will remain so profound that he would undergo the heights of divine illumination followed by the depths of soul-crushing sorrow

initial sin giving way to a greater Arc of redemption but they're tortured sojourn in the realm of the clepote leaves it behind a kind of Scar upon their very being such they have a tendency towards such sins and actually Delight in them are are indifferent to such devilish Behavior

but once he's undergone both radical evil and radical good he dialectically rises above both and ascends to the very Realm of the Divine itself

In transcending his soul as the suffering job the Messiah becomes the chief power over the abyss itself

Evil is tricked into enabling its own undoing, and the mystic becomes a divine double agent, navigating paradox to heal a broken world. 

A cosmic warrior who deliberately enters spiritual darkness, risking personal corruption to redeem the whole.
The mission remains hidden from both the uninitiated the Qlippoth itself.

[17](https://www.lawofone.info/s/17).[19](https://www.lawofone.info/s/17#19) **Questioner:** How did **Jesus** learn this during his incarnation?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This entity learned the ability by a natural kind of remembering at a very young age. Unfortunately, this entity first discovered his ability to penetrate intelligent infinity by becoming the distortion you call “angry” at a ****playmate****. This entity was touched by the entity known as **Jesus** to you and was fatally wounded.  
  
Thus the one known as **Jesus** became aware that there dwelt in him a terrible potential. This entity determined to discover how to use this energy for the good, not for the negative. This entity was extremely positively polarized and remembered more than most Wanderers do.

[17](https://www.lawofone.info/s/17).[20](https://www.lawofone.info/s/17#20) **Questioner:** How did this aggressive action against a ****playmate**** affect **Jesus** in his spiritual growth? Where did he go after his physical death?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The entity you call **Jesus** was galvanized by this experience and began a lifetime of seeking and searching. This entity studied first day and night in its own religious constructs which you call Judaism and was learned enough to be a rabbi, as you call the teach/learners of this particular rhythm or distortion of understanding, at a very young age.  
  
At the age of approximately thirteen and one-half of your years, this entity left the dwelling place of its earthly family, as you would call it, and walked into many other places seeking further information. This went on sporadically until the entity was approximately twenty-five, at which time it returned to its family dwelling, and learned and practiced the art of its earthly father.  
  
When the entity had become able to integrate or synthesize all experiences, the entity began to speak to other-selves and teach/learn what it had felt during the preceding years to be of an worthwhile nature. The entity was absolved karmically of the destruction of an other-self when it was in its last portion of lifetime and spoke upon what you would call a cross saying, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” In forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of action, or what you call karma.

In Kabbalah, a "lightning flash" symbolizes the sudden, powerful flow of divine energy, often represented as light, that moves through the Sefirot (divine emanations) on the Tree of Life. Signifying the rapid transmission of spiritual illumination and insight; it is typically depicted as a lightning bolt.



72 Names of God: Technology for the Soul

The 72 Names are each 3-letter sequences that act like an index to specific, spiritual frequencies; believed to possess certain spiritual powers as combinations of divine energies that can help with healing, protection, and other spiritual endeavors as they help us focus and use the gifts of the Spirit.

Within the Torah, we find that there are three consecutive verses from Exodus, each with 72 letters, found in chapter 14, verses 19-21. 



Shem HaMephorash


# Gematria 

We know that language, and therefore words, carry immense power. Words are the key to the communication of our emotions, our intentions, the expression of our personality, passions etc.
But what is it that words are made of? Letters of course. Seems simple enough. But have you ever asked yourself.. what are letters are made of? We don't often pay attention to the exact science and art that lies behind these words.

In the world of Jewish mysticism, practitioners of Kabbalah devised 
gematria is a numerological system by which Hebrew letters. correspond to numbers.



Specifically the power and energy that lies in the numbers that correspond to each letter.

Stems from greek Geomatria - the study of numbers.

Words are energy

Now letters on their own are somewhat hollow. When they are combined, they take on a new meaning, more than the sum of its parts(holism, ba dum tsss). 

Each letter has its own unique energy, in combining them, it creates a new energy, a synergy of sorts.

Within the realm of Jewish mysticism it is believed that the Hebrew language is the original of all languages. Hebrew is considered to be a pure language, the language of metaphor, which the divine used to create existence. 

The letters and the words take on a whole new dimension conveying the power, the force of creation that lies within each thing that's named by certain words or combination of words.

When someone is sick or ill, praying for a family member is done by using their original Hebrew name - thought to channel their souls energy. 

With words you are essentially channeling energy. You're trying to express the inexpressible. Punctuation, inflection, changes the message and the energy being transmitted.

Language is energy, and letters/words are containers for this energy - without such a vessel everything is quite messy - and we would never be able to communicate with one another. 
Instruments for us to reach one another. 

Intelligent people are very careful with the words they speak and how they choose to say it. 

You need to find the words that resonate between you and another. That resonance is really where you create the connection, a bridge where you can convey sentiments, feelings.

Letters are like bricks.
The bricks combine into a structure, and that structure is the word that conveys a message, a sort of hovering symmetry which is more than the sum of its parts. However, these parts all have their own energy. 

That's just one word. When you combine several words you get a sentence. Sentences combine to then create a paragraph, paragraphs combine to create a chapter, chapters create books, books create volumes, and so on.

Everything begins with letters, whether through speech or written word, its all the same idea.

If a letter is a channeler of energy, it can be further analyzed and dissected.
Every letter has a shape, this "shapes" the energy which is carries and describes.
Then we also have the meaning of each of the letters. 
Alef can mean master, teacher, etc.
Each of the letters in the hebrew language has its own associated meanings.

There is a third element as-well. Its numerical equivalent.
Gematria the art and science of Jewish numerology.

22 letters.

You could think of it like 22 transmissions, each one with its own particular personality, its own shape, meaning, and its own number.

Film and projector   - NUMBERS MATRIX 


When two values align, there is a chance that the words may be connected. 
It's not just that the numbers align

For example, the sum total of letters in the words yayin (wine) equals 70; so does the sum total in the word sod (secret).

In the Talmud it states

“Wine enters, and secrets emerge” (Eiruvin 65a)

It would be easy to go overboard, to get too caught up and sensationalist about it all. People love the exotic. They love the mysterious, that which is intriguing. Gematria opens a door which gives one all of these things, as though you are cracking the code. Its easy to lose the point of it all. Gematria has to be a part of a comprehensive way of looking at life in a responsible way. One could easily begin to look for numbers in every single thing which they come across, look far into details that have no real meaning to them and begin seeing all these numbers that don't have any real significance. 

It can become farcical and silly, but the truth is that the practice is a very sacred study into a part of our being and reality.

Gematria is used all the time in the Talmud, but in a very useful and insightful way, designed as an accessory to help support a particular idea. 

It is like dessert. The main meal must be consumed before you begin attempting to satisfying your hunger for sweets, otherwise you're going to end up spiking your blood sugar and not having as much of an appetite for that which has real nutrients. 
It is used to help support, or to uncover a deeper layer of a bigger picture. 
It does carry weight and have power, and thus must be wielded responsibly. 

Balotany Rizal??
Every name in Hebrew is the force that gives life and reveals the soul of the object called by that name.

We don't always see it obviously, they have it in their soul and that power. Sometimes it is obvious, its clear this person lives up to their name

We all have faculties in our soul that we have not accessed

Adam represents humans - a miracle and wonder of existence in totality 
Adam is connected to the word MA
Ma means what
Wonder - beyond us, transcendent

Everything on Earth is multi-layered 

Human - cells - dna etc.

How can we indeed cut through the surface and tap into the inner layers beneath?

Gematria is one of those ways. How deep does the rabbit hole go? 
We honestly don't know
Words in general are one of the ways, but gematria gives us a deeper peek beneath.

Surface is the word
Numerology - way of understanding what lies beneath the name

Gematria is an instrument, a tool 

Where the supernatural meets the natural, the extraordinary in the ordinary, connecting the divine unity with existence. 

There is nowhere that the numerology, the gematrias, don't have a role in understanding the deeper meaning behind words, and behind experiences. 

When you really begin to study this, it opens up a whole new dimension that you would have never imagined

Similar to what science or art does for us.

That's why it is called the art and science of Jewish numerology.

What do science and art do? They reveal a deeper truth
They reveal something that we did not see beforehand

For 1,000s of years we have experienced things. We all have a shared stage on which we have been acting upon. What have scientists done? They discovered the underlying forces which make things tick, that propels the world to spin, and the stars to shimmer. They discover what shapes the reality that we are experiencing (at-least trying to anyway)

The same goes for art, putting into form that which was previously unknowable, feelings and emotion given shape and form, taken from the abstraction of shared uman experience. 

Gematria is a certain place where science meets art. There is a certain eloquence to it all, the poetics of numbers.

Hebrew is a language of metaphor, of feelings and meaning. Life is monotonous. If you're able to recognize the music, the poetry, the eloquence within your experiences everything changes. 

But if you open yourself up to things happen.
Maybe you're doing something routine, but you're looking for the magic, the enchantment, the surprise. Gematria is part of that adventure, the ability to look at things not just at the surface but to go beneath the surface.

What is the number involved here? What is the music, the rhythym, the tempo of the different elements or forces at work that are not so obvious? 

When you do that, you begin to notice that there is a whole narrative, a whole scripts beneath the surface, some higher choreography - we could either join and align ourselves that that choreography and then dance with it, or we could resist and just exist in our surface level of safety. Gematria is more than just a play with numbers and words. Its really about looking at things and trying to understand their deeper meaning. It makes you more introspective and sensitive to the world around you - you start looking at things not for what you see, what you see is not what you get. 
There is always more going on 
there's always a deeper story

It's a tool to dig deeper, to recognize deeper meanings
create connections to experiences in our lives that we would never fully experience without going to that place. 

Gematria is one of the gifts we have that help us probe, that help us explore and dissect the reality that we see, and see them in a new light - something emerges

To discover another petal on the flower we haven't seen before.
Digging deeper into what you already have. 


# Introduction to Kabbala

Jewish mysticism is bizarre. It's almost like science fiction.
Contrary to what you may typically think with mystics, reaching 'upwards' towards the heavens, in the Jewish school of mystery, they are described as going down, descending into a garden.

This stems from the hebrew word pardes, which translates to "orchard" and appears 3 times within the Hebrew Bible. It's etymological origin is of the same Persian root which acted as the source for the word paradise in latin and greek.

The acronym PARDES is also a  mnemonic device that describes the four types of biblical interpretation in Judaism

- **Peshat**: The literal or plain meaning of the text
- **Remez**: A hint or allusion to a deeper, allegorical meaning
- **Derash**: A homiletical interpretation, or the discovery of a moral or ethical lesson
- **Sod**: A secret or mystical meaning, usually through Kabbalah]

story of rabbis - lnklngnklga

In traditional Jewish lore, the descent into the garden is considered a relatively dangerous journey.
On one hand, it is incredibly intriguing, but on the other it should be proceeded with caution, not without a subtle undercurrent of danger. 

The traditional books of Kabbalistic practice are intimidating.

What does mysticism really mean? There's no real consensus.
However, in our best efforts, we could describe it as a non-rational mode by which one explores, experiences, or learns about the fundamental reality they are situated within. 
In addition to that, its the traditions which accrue based off of those experiences.

Mystics are having visions, they're having experiences, and they're reporting back on these experiences, or the way that the content of these experiences have transformed them personally.

Nowadays the word Kabbala is used to refer to all of Jewish mysticism, but ultimately it is a very specific kind of Jewish mysticism which emerged around the 13th century within parts of Southern France and Spain. It is quite likely Israelite/Jewish mysticism stretches back all the way before they began to write things down and historical records appeared.

Interestingly, some of the earliest texts recovered in the Israelite literature were written by women that were mystics. 

Prophecy, at this time, appeared where the israelite God - Yahweh - is said to speak to people, an in turn, those people began to speak on behalf of Yahweh.

The word prophet simply means to speak for. 

Theophany on the other hand was a situation where God appeared - an idea stemming from ancient greek and israelige religion.

God appearing is a relatively common motif in ancient religions. Oftentimes rituals were meant to compel the god to appear, this being in temples and other kinds of venues. 

Sometimes Yahweh would be depicted as a sort of divine monarch - a king/leader residing upon a throne. At a certain point, the israelites grew a tremendous distaste for depicting their god in any way, this taking away from Gods incorporeal and invisible nature.

In the theophony to Moses, Yahweh tells moses that if you see me face to face you will die.

There are moments where god appears to the israelites, but it is somewhat occluded- hidden in the arafel, which means something like the gloom or the darkness. The light is hidden somewhat amongst the fog. God appears, but is hidden at the same time. 

The 4 main theophonies we ses are of Abraham, Moses, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, with Isaiah and Ezekiel being the most important. In both cases, it is terrifying.

Yahweh is not your friend, your buddy, or your drinking pal. You do not want Yahweh showing up for you. Yahweh appearing is terrifying, and when he shows up, the witnesses are quite literally shaking in their books in terror. Physically sweating, shaking, losing the ability to speak.
The experience of the divine is terrifying.

Awe-some , good. A little bit of awe, it's kinda nice, it's cool.
Awe-ful , bad. A lot of awe, completely full of it to to point that its too much.

Isaiah even says "I'm finished" thinking that was it, he was going to die. 

This may reflect a deeper history of israelit and shamanic practices, ecstatic experts that were able to withstand a visitation from Yahweh. 

Yahweh is basically telling them how to fix their country. The prophets then criticize society in a general way, along religious and social terms.

They acted as shamans, not to help fix the soul of an individual, but for the entire community. 

Ezekiel, back in the day, was highly respected, but today would likely be institutionalized. He would lie naked in the streets for days at a time. It goes to show that what is insanity in one culture is prophecy in another.

Someone may very well functionally be a shaman in one world, you take them and place that same individual into a capitalistic world where they are forced to work - and they look like a complete nutcase.


These two become foundational to merkavah mystics - which was the dominant form of mysticism for 800 years before the Kabbalah took foothold. 

Yahweh is seen on a sort of flying chariot, typically male. 

There were even roaming prophetic bands which used music and dancing as a way to induce one in a state of ecstasis. (Grateful Dead?)

Prophets came in both genders, man and women
It is also quite important to not that the two oldest pieces of literature in the Hebrew bible were both prophetic pieces which were attested to women. Devora and miriam

Women were quite respected and involved in this section of the religious world, as opposed to nearly every other culture of this time. Hulda, for example, was a woman that vetted the legitimacy of the torah (although perhaps her neck was on the line and this was for political reasons)

Prophecy seems to have had ecstatic and non-ecstatic forms. 

There is nothing we know about how these states were generated, other than music and dance.

However, quite recently in 2020, archaeologists were able to find trace amounts of THC and CBD in a shrine dated back to 760-715BC. In Tel Arad, one of the few Yahweh shrines to survive the ancient world, they found bits of burnt cannabis and frankensense. This being a somewhat small room, we can only be led to assume that they must have been hotboxing
![images.jpeg](/img/user/images/images.jpeg)(Treatise of the Dragons)

We ultimately know nothing of their meditation or breathing techniques, any rituals, or perhaps drug usage. 

The social institution of prophecy seemed to come to a halt after the destruction of the Israelite and Judean states in the 6th century BCE. Why? Because they .... well shouldn't they have seen it coming? Something wasn't right, you guys must have been talking to the wrong Yahweh.

Ultiamtely a switch occurs. We go from oral, god speaking to the prophets, and then the prophets relaying this, to visual "and I saw." Showing as opposed to telling. 

Prophets didn't completely go away, you've probably heard of Jesus. We also see a new form of Kabbala, Prophetic kabbalah (sometimes called “ecstatic Kabbalah) emerge later in the 13th century from Abraham Abulafia.
