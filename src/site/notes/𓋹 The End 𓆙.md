(still a lot of work to do here check back in a month)

I had gone to the dispensary, 
and, as I was checking out, 
began in conversation with the cashier. 
He asked me what I had been up to that night, and I told him,
"I've been going down a rabbit hole on the number [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]."
He began to tell me about the number 23, 
how he had gone down a rabbit hole on that before, 
and also about a book that opened his eyes to things years prior,
"Behold, A Pale Horse".

I had never heard of anything about the number 23 before, except for the movie featuring Jim Carrey. At first, paranoia struck in(good product), and for a moment I thought that maybe this man was subtly attempting to diss me -  referencing the film and mocking my obsession with a silly number directly to my face. I did get in there kinda close to closing.... but no, that couldn't be right. I looked it up and saw there was in fact quite some legitimate obsession with the number, what I'm sure inspired the script for the blockbuster. 

This all reminded me of a song which I used to listen to years prior, titled "23".
I had gone to look it up, and the individual with the username 23 on Soundcloud was sitting at exactly 7777 followers. How interesting, 4 7s.


![9730BA45-23AE-48EE-B9CE-4F00C9F7D715.png| 300](/img/user/images/9730BA45-23AE-48EE-B9CE-4F00C9F7D715.png)

After reminiscing to a song which seemed to hold the memories of a barbeque held in the summer of 2018, whoever's Mustang my elderly Grandfather was revving I can't fully recollect, I decided to search for the book which was recommended to me 

![462A7FCF-67AB-4091-BD3D-72BE12B51277.png| 300](/img/user/images/462A7FCF-67AB-4091-BD3D-72BE12B51277.png)

I didn't think too much of it other than the fact that it was a really cool little 
double synchronicity. Somehow the timing aligned perfectly to reflect repeating numbers in both areas. You could check both numerical quantities 2 hours later and would be missing out, the orchestration of such navigation is incalculable. Throughout this period I was working quite heavily on [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]], and felt this was just some motivation to keep moving forward. I mean, this sort of strangeness was a regular part of nearly every day of mine at this point. Much of the direction things took began to expose a Book of Revelation, end times theme, something I didn't necessarily anticipate, but found interesting as I continued to pull what I could out of the backlog. The title of the book, "Behold a Pale Horse," being a reference to Revelation, seemed to inspire a further embrace of this emerging theme.  

"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
	Revelation 6:7-8 (KJV)

Weeks go by, and one of the things I ended up discovering was that the Greek word for The Angel of Death, Azrael, translated to an Isopsephy value of 144, a number which the Book of Revelation made quite important.

![azrael.jpg](/img/user/images/azrael.jpg)

Having already immersed myself in deep study of Azazel, the scapegoat, I started to look further into the very similarly named Azrael. I discovered that Azrael was essentially who the verse of Revelation was mentioning, in regards to the one who rode the pale horse. The deeper connection budding its head, I decided to look a little further and try some gematria.  

![Pasted image 20250513040205.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250513040205.png)

I also went to listen to that song again, but this time on YouTube. 

![BB2E60A4-441B-4C68-ACAD-92CD5CC6B6B8.png| 300](/img/user/images/BB2E60A4-441B-4C68-ACAD-92CD5CC6B6B8.png)

Fast forward a little bit, a few weeks, and I'm taking Adderall for the first time in my life. 
Nothing too crazy, just 20mg, something they prescribe to kids(which baffles me). 
My brother had gotten a sample from his doctor a while back 
after all he said was that he was sometimes tired. 
I'm in his grandmother's backyard gardening like a soldier. 
We watched the movie Azrael the night before, and it was pretty good. Spooky.
It is May 4th, our mothers birthday, and I am certainly feeling the force. 

Editing this after the fact, and digging further into the context of the situation, it seems that this Adderall idea may have not been a good idea, I was already in a (insert movie title) state, but perhaps I was protected on this journey by...

![IMG_6473.png| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_6473.png)


![IMG_6474 1.png| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_6474%201.png)


![IMG_6475 1.png| 400](/img/user/images/IMG_6475%201.png)

Later that night I found myself, well, not really coming down. The high kept persistent, and I was forced to meditate for a while, eventually just to lay down. I was even sweating a little bit, and from time to time would shake with energy. It was unrelenting. No wonder those kids are so good at Fortnite. I began to breathe deeply, and, thanks to the added focus, I sat there with mindful precision for quite a while. 

At a certain point, I found myself having a sort of inkling. I feel some other force attempting to enter my space. I sit for a moment and try to discern what it is that's occurring, and after some moments, I discover, oh, it's Azrael. Ooooof course. Well, I know that my subconscious is primed to be filled with things centered around this supposed angel, this isn't necessarily that surprising. Perhaps I'm some sort of receiver that has been warmed up over the last few weeks for this meeting, the drug opening a channel of perception/energy in which this is now able to take place. Or, perhaps my brain is flooded with an excess of dopamine, and I am beginning to touch a very light state of, not necessarily psychosis, but lets say, fantastical creative imagery. 

Either direction I'm here for it.

Somewhat humored, and deepening into a letting go, I began to entertain this active imaginative experience. I remember reading through Carl Jung's Red Book, his most profound writing, the entirety being a recollection of these sorts of experiences which he himself had. I allowed it all to unfold. The swirling of that which was running itself through my mental sphere, a culmination and combination of what the months prior contained. It felt as though this being was attempting to relay to me a message, one which was tinged with a dark truth, somewhat rough - the delivery had to be sensitive. I didn't want to shy away, but instead sought honesty, for the band aid to be ripped off. I could feel a tangible bit of hesitancy, a shyness, a reluctance, but also, a deep pleasure in the fact that the transmission of truth was unfolding, that receptivity was present, as I heard in my head - "4 years..... and 7 days." 
	If I were to really slow things down in that moment, you could see the exact point in which part of my psyche began to leave the trance I was in, barely turning back online just to throw the little 7 day part in there, it was hilarious(amidst the admittedly heavy theme). 

![Pasted image 20250520125444.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250520125444.png)

Alright so that's it, I die in 4 years or something? 4 years and 7 days? Just me or are we talking worldwide nuclear warfare? Do I get some sort of disease and die early maybe? Should I not cross the street during this time? No airplanes or amusement parks, got it.

Let's throw this into the calendar, hopefully my schedules free.

In doing some digging, I discovered there was, not exactly 4 years (and 7 days) to the date, but an asteroid that was deemed potentially dangerous, supposed to pass the Earth in arooouuunnnd 

3 years and 11 months. 
Hmmm.

Friday the 13th, 
April 2029, 
Asteroid Apophis 99942 

I spend the last 3 years discovering that I may 
_potentially_ 
be the reincarnation of the final Pharoah of Egypt ... 
a man they called "Little Caesar's",
maybe even the messiah,
and now, 
here I am,
having a prophetic moment,
with the Adderall Angel of Death,
discovering that there's an asteroid the size of the Rose Bowl,
coming suspiciously close to us,
named after the the Egyptian embodiment of destruction and disorder,
viewed as the greatest adversary to Ra, 
whom attempts to consume the sun every night,
holding the title "Enemy of Ra," 
as-well as "the Lord of Chaos."

The thickening of the plot here is absolutely astounding.

![[Apep and Ra.JPG]]

When Apophis was first discovered in 2004, initial observations indicated a small chance, 2.4%, that it would collide with Earth in 2029. This sparked great concern, and Apophis was placed on the highest level of the Torino scale, a method for evaluating impact hazards. Later observations opened this possibility to 2036 or 2068(given it were to have its trajectory continuously altered by Earths gravitational orbit on each passing). Preliminary observations in January 2013 allowed them to predict that this would ultimately not happen, and we would be safe. In March 2021, new radar observations allowed astronomers to precisely recalculate Apophis's orbit. These refined measurements definitively ruled out any risk of the asteroid hitting Earth for at least the next 100 years. As a result, Apophis was removed from international impact hazard lists, alleviating previous concerns about a potential collision, what would have been devastating, the reason why the asteroid was named after the Egyptian god of chaos and destruction. It would have caused a cataclysm unlike anything else our species has ever seen in recorded history. Not on the level of what wiped out the dinosaurs, but still, it would drastically affect the systemic global ecosystem. 

The average diameter of Apophis is estimated to be between 330 and 340 meters (around 1,100 feet). Due to its elongated and possibly peanut-like shape, its longest side stretches to approximately 450 meters (nearly 1,500 feet). To put this into perspective, Apophis is often described as being taller than the Eiffel Tower, or comparable in length to about five NFL football fields.
![40081662-9329825-image-a-1_1614947641180.jpg](/img/user/images/40081662-9329825-image-a-1_1614947641180.jpg)

The average distance between Earth and the Moon is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). We have Geostationary satellites that orbit Earth at an altitude of 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers).

When Apophis performs its drive-by, it is supposed to come 19,800 miles (31,860 kilometers) above Earths surface, ten times closer to us than the Moon, closer than some of our satellites. 

These are fighting words. 
Apophis plans on entering our bubble.
It will be the closest largest thing that we will have ever observed,
visible from the ground with your own naked eye(final days nudist colony anyone?).
This asteroid is going to rock our world with a once-in-a-lifetime experience, 
coming within a cosmic whisker of Earth, close enough to let us hear her purr. 

Every time Apophis has passed us thus far, Nasa sonographers were able to pick up audible noises from its passing. 

December 21, 2004
	"I'll be right back" *evil laugh*
January 9, 2013
	"Yall better not move or nothin"
March 6, 2021
	"hol on, 1 more time"

If there's one thing this asteroid and I have in common, 
it's that we both keep coming back.

Gareth Collins, a professor in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London, estimates that Apophis, if it were to strike Earth at 45,000 mph (72,000 km/h) —   the average speed of asteroid impact  —  it would release energy analogous to

10,000,000,000,000,000,000  (10 billion billion) Joules

For those of us with no capacity to comprehend such a numbers meaning,
other than,
# big, 
he then goes on to say,

"This is equivalent to the explosive yield of the global nuclear arsenal," and further, 
"About 100,000 times more than the energy of the Chelyabinsk meteor 
and a million times more energy than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima."

Thankfully we're safe though.
Right?

Some recent studies (in 2024) have explored the very low-probability scenario of Apophis being struck by another, smaller asteroid, which could theoretically alter its path. All it would take would be a simple meteoroid, approximately 1 meter in diameter, to hit Apophis at the wrong place, wrong time. This would be enough to knock Apophis from its current trajectory, putting it on a collision course with Earth. This may have even already happened, Apophis being outside of our line of vision currently, and we would have absolutely no idea until 2027 (at the earliest). However, these studies concluded that the chances of such an event deflecting Apophis into a collision course with Earth are exceedingly remote, on the order of one in a million or less.

As I was first putting this together on May 15th, admiring Bladee's subtle references to the scarlet thread([[Prequel𓂀/Shani\|Shani]]) theme, I saw this...

![Pasted image 20250520140011.png| 300](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250520140011.png)

and then a few weeks after, I went to listen to it on Soundcloud, for the first time, and was like 1,111.  🫣😦😳😵

![image2 1.png| 300](/img/user/images/image2%201.png)

The font on the thumbnail looks a lot like the Enochian script...

Who knows..... maybe some aliens have decided that we've got it coming to us, and they decide to pull it in a little closer at the last second? Maybe its a mothership itself, the Annunaki God's which seeded the globe, returning to the planet once again(have you seen Alien vs Predator?). 
Genuinely, I know its a bit sci-fi and absurd, but could these things be a possibility if we really consider the conditions of our planet today?  

Good thing is, is that on May 15th, the Trump administration decided to propose a plan which would slash NASA's overall budget by 24%. This would include a steep, wait for it, _47%_ cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). This department is responsible for planetary defense efforts, including; detecting, tracking, and characterizing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets, managing programs and missions aimed at understanding the risk of impacts(developing mitigation strategies), as-well as overseeing crucial planetary defense missions, like the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor space telescope, which was designed to detect potentially hazardous asteroids. It would be the largest single-year cut to NASA in U.S. history.

Casey Dreier, Chief of Space Policy at The Planetary Society, stated, 
"This would be a devastating budget for NASA science... 
It would force the agency to effectively dismantle its science program."

More from a group letter sent by concerned scientists and stakeholders to Congressional leaders...

"Such a drastic reduction would inflict immediate and irreparable damage upon the nation's space science enterprise... This proposed budget cut is not merely a line item adjustment; it represents a potential dark age for American space science, sacrificing our cosmic inheritance for short-term expediency."

I for one argue that we give Boeing the contract for asteroid deflection.

Have you seen the movie Don't Look Up?

Is it possible that some of what was to come was leaked in this screenplay, released to the public without their awareness of the coming Apophis? A sort of humorous ploy, they let the working class watch the film as though it were simply entertainment, and not a warning for what to come, hiding in plain sight what only those who are on the in know? At the very end of the movie, a certain select group of elites, the ultra-rich, escape on a unique spaceship, making it away from the destroyed Earth and arriving on another planet(22,740 years later). They emerge naked, paralleling the Garden of Eden. Discussing the success rate of the cryochambers, the president gets out and remarks that “We only had 47 dead in our section,” right before... well.. you should just see for yourself...

What about the movie Melancholia?
Released November 11th, 2011
11-11-11
Its a film showing the different ways in which people are coping with a coming planet, Melancholia, which is flying directly into the Earth. Now, it's a god awful movie, incredibly boring, at-least for me, maybe if I had some mushrooms or something I might get a little out of it(now we're onto something), but it is so inline with the times. In-fact 1hour and 11minutes in, one of the main characters begins describing how scientists have said this thing is just going to fly by and it is not going to hit the planet, trying to calm down his wife as though she was becoming senile. The science seems to debunk things, in the same way science has debunked Apophis. The charts and diagrams, all of it is essentially very similar to Apophis.
I'm not saying this is some in your face illuminati film, but I mean, the repeating 1's.... I think God leaves little breadcrumbs through the creative work of different people. As art comes through someone, big man upstairs can drop little pieces of the celestial puzzle inside without them having any awareness. Do this on a mass scale, across time and with all the different little humans, and you got yourself a game that only those with 3 eyes can participate it. 

![melancholia.jpeg](/img/user/images/melancholia.jpeg)

In every single movie that has ever involved this scenario, the government never admits that the world is coming to an end until the last 72 hours or so.... 
What if they do end up seeing that this thing was heading right towards Earth?
Would they tell us?
Right away?
What about all the panic that would erupt?
And oh, those financial markets, they would be thrown asunder...

Thankfully Nasa has the technology to do something about it.
In 2022 their DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was a success. 
Flying a 200 million dollar spaceship into an asteroid, they successfully redirected it's course, 
proving the efficiency of the use of a kinetic impactor. 
There is a plan to meet to flying rock in space, face to face, kamikazi-ing into the object.  
We theoretically have the capacity to alter its course, and, if we are lucky, divert it directly into Florida(304's... TO TARTARUS).

"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter. 
	Revelation 8:10–11

We should consider the fact that this impact would throw a substantial amount of dirt and debris into the upper atmosphere, debris which would not clear for a considerable amount of time. 

In 1816, the largest eruption in recorded history occurred at Mount Tambora, a volcano located in what is now Indonesia. The eruption caused so much Sulphur to fly into the atmosphere (sorry I had eggs for breakfast) that global temperatures dropped, leading to cold weather and food shortages. The reason for the suns absence was unknown to the world at the time, causing mass panic. They did not know that volcanic ash and debris was thrown up into the stratosphere and had blocked the sun, causing a gradual lowering of temperatures. This time was infamously dubbed as the "The Year Without a Summer." This led to famines all across the Northern hemisphere, quite literally one of the darkest periods in human history. 

Coincidentally, sun spots (temporary dark areas from strong magnetic fields) appeared (on the sun) that were large enough to be seen by the human eye. This gave seeking scientists a potential cause for the absence of light which used to rain upon and nourish the land. 

"The large spots which may now be seen upon the sun's disk have given rise to ridiculous apprehensions and absurd predictions. These spots are said to be the cause of the remarkable and wet weather we have had this Summer; and the increase of these spots is represented to announce a general removal of heat from the globe, the extinction of nature, and the end of the world."
	from the _London Chronicle_

A scientist in Italy predicted that the Sun would go out on the 18th of July 1816. The prophecy caused riots, suicides, and fervor(especially of the Religious variety) all over Europe. From a newspaper of the age,

"A Bath girl woke her aunt and shouted at her that the world was ending, and the woman promptly plunged into a coma. In Liege, a huge cloud in the shape of a mountain hovered over the town, causing alarm among the "old women" who expected the end of the world on the eighteenth. In Ghent, a regiment of cavalry passing through the town during a thunderstorm blew their trumpets, causing "three-fourths of the inhabitants" to rush forth and throw themselves on their knees in the streets, thinking they had heard the seventh trumpet."

That was the context of the month which Lord Byron wrote his poem, the whole of it could be seen as a reference to Matthew 24:29 (which is heavily apocalyptic)
"the sun shall be darkened."

Now, to understand fully the situation unfolding here we will have to take a brief detour into the 15th century; Particularly to the golden age of England, the Elizabethan era (1558-1603). The story begins with a world class mathematician/secret agent, and his sidekick, an ambiguous alchemist with a suspect past and only the lower 70% of his ears...(No this is not the introduction to an anime). The hunt for buried treasure, angelically powered international espionage, the formula for the end of the world, paranormally ordained wife swapping, and the original celestial language which Adam spoke in the Garden of Eden.

Firstly, let me introduce you to our main protagonist, Dr. John Dee. 

![Pasted image 20250505224120.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250505224120.png)

![Screenshot 2025-05-05 223947.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Screenshot%202025-05-05%20223947.png)

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 044257.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20044257.png)

One of the most influential figures of Elizabethan England, John Dee was a true polymath. He was a mathematician, teacher, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and linguist, as well as a skilled navigator and cartographer. Dee was also a pioneering scholar and occult philosopher, collecting and curating one of England’s largest private libraries(with many rare private picks). His intellect and wide-ranging expertise was renowned, and he served as a trusted advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, whose court frequently sought his counsel on matters of science, exploration, and the mystical arts.

John was so good at cryptography that he was the founder of England's first secret intelligence service, preceding what would eventually be the UK's infamous MI6. Under Queen Elizabeth I's rule, he established the worlds most comprehensive network of spies. When he would write to the Royal Highness, he would signify his authorship with only a few numbers, 007. That's right, this is where the smooth and cool James Bond hijacked his famous trademark from. 

![007.jpg](/img/user/images/007.jpg)

Dee was also the man that coined the famous term "British Empire." He had met the queen when she was younger and under house arrest by her half sister (whom would later provide the material for the popular "Bloody Mary" myth). Elizabeth's science tutor, they developed a friendship that would last. After becoming Queen, she funded and supported many of his endeavors, and later protected John from those claiming he was a sorcerer into witchcraft.

 Already extracting all that he could perceive from the natural world, Dee's curiosity began to branch out. He eventually became concentrated on the idea of theurgy, God becoming directly involved in our affairs through the work of miracles or divine intervention. He sought knowledge which could not be formulated from the material plane, embracing theories that through the study and practice of invoking supernatural deities, i.e. angels, he may be able to acquire secret or lost information, perhaps insight into the mysteries of existence. 

It seemed however, that John would run into blocks. Consistently hitting walls in his personal practice, he failed to manifest anything magnificent. However, things seemed to have taken a turn in the year of 1581. According to his journal, while kneeling in prayer, John was suddenly in the bright glowing presence of archangel Uriel. Here the entity handed over to John a clear crystal, what he would end up calling a shewstone(the OG term for crystal ball). Dr. Dee was told that by gazing through it, he would be able to establish contact with angels. What would eventually become known as scrying, John was given a technique whereby messages could be transmitted from alternate realities by gazing into the appropriate reflective object. 

![medium_a127915__0002_.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/medium_a127915__0002_.jpg)
	The original on display in the British Museum today 

John followed the instructions that Uriel gave him to a T, but alas, found no success. Eventually he gave up and began to look for eyes he could outsource his venture to, some sort of scryer who could actually see. Interviewing many men, none of them seemed to be the vehicle of visionary value Dee was after. They either failed or attempted to blow smoke up his rear end, deceitful and dubious fraudsters caught by his careful attention to detail. 

Eventually, however, John came to meet who would end up being the second most important character in our story, the mysterious enigma of a man - Edward Kelley(born 1555). Originally introducing himself as Edward Talbot(if either of those were even his real name), he wore a cap to hide the fact that both ears had been chipped, a common punishment for forgery during the age. Despite the disguise, he seemed to be a natural. In their first meeting Kelley could see, hear, and communicate with the angels. John Dee, even with a critical eye, saw that this was not Maybelline, he must have been born with it. Convinced that Kelley's skill was genuine, he was chosen for the road ahead. This was the beginning of an intense 7 year period in which the two would undertake scrying sessions on an almost daily basis. 

What famously sits in the museum with all of John Dee's magical tools is an obsidian mirror, thought to be used for scrying in addition to Uriel's present. Modern research completed within just the last 3 years has shown that this mirror originally came from the Aztec region of Mexico. In Aztec culture, obsidian mirrors were powerful ritual objects connected to the god Tezcatlipoca—“The Smoking Mirror”—a deity associated with divination, magic, and the ability to see into other worlds. Many thought Dee was unknowingly drawing on a tradition of mystical vision that stretched back centuries. However, in his journals it seems that this mirror didn't really work, he didn't actually use it hence why it was never made part of his Enochian system. Just a neat detail I noticed in research that, seemingly everyone else misses. Perhaps still it provided inspiration for the title of the show, "Black Mirror"? Some speculate that the mysterious extraterrestrial black object became somewhat of an archetype and was inspiration for the monolith in Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.

![1280px-John_Dee's_Aztec_Scrying_Mirror.jpg](/img/user/images/1280px-John_Dee's_Aztec_Scrying_Mirror.jpg)

If you have ever seen any sort of magical imagery with someone staring into a crystal ball, this is where it originally came from. Eventually the angels would teach John and Edward that this device could be used, by contacting the appropriate angelic governor of the appropriate region, to spy on anyone, anywhere. I am the eye in the sky, looking at yoooouuuuuu, I can reead your miindd. They were unknowingly taking part in, and outlining the structure for, the worlds first MK Ultra remote viewing project. It's quite fitting given Dee's association with the development of England's first secret spy organization(and a good thing they didn't have acid). John Dee was the original crazed archetypal wizard alchemist whose story has inspired our culture for centuries after his death.

When they first began, the two received directions to construct solomonic like furniture and ritual objects which they would use as part of a system of astral magic. These included inscribed tables, wax seals, and other tools, all believed to be essential for safely navigating the world of spirits. What is now generally referred to as the Heptarchic system, it was a synthesis of the reigning magical themes with those of the past, an improvement on the established medieval system(what some scholars are arguably more impressed by than any of the Enochian stuff). One of these was an improvement on the Sigillum Dei —reimagined as the Sigillum Dei Aemeth—which integrated angelic Enochian script inside intricate geometric layers, surrounded by the names of a new divine hierarchy(DLC update). I must note, it looks awfully similar to Apple's new Ai logo, but...  it is just a heptagram after all.... 

![Original 1.png](/img/user/images/Original%201.png)

All of this preparation served as a grand set up for what would, about a year later, begin to be unveiled. Dee, being a pious Christian, would force Kelley into long periods of prayer, fasting, and other methods of purification prior to having him gaze into a shewstone nearly all day. In his journals, Dee would document everything Kelley would see or hear. With their ritual gear assembled and their shewstones polished, Dee and Kelley found themselves on the threshold of something entirely unexpected: the transmission of a celestial book. But not just any book... the book which Enoch himself was said to have copied down during his trip to heaven, containing the original language of the angels, what was lost forever during the great flood. 

The 1583 Saturn-Jupiter conjunction was critical for understanding Dee's work. It signaled, according to prevailing astrological belief, the end of an era and the imminent start of major, potentially apocalyptic, global transformations. This was due to the shift from a watery to a fiery trigon, a starry pivot which only occurs every 200-240 years. Dee felt that the end of the world was immanent, this being largely inspired by astronomical observations. The coming great conjunction was foreshadowed by the appearance of a supernova in 1572, an extremely bright and lengthy comet in 1577, as-well as a solar eclipse in 1582. There was also a significant earthquake which shook London during the week of Easter in 1580. He was fascinated by the apocalyptic prophecies of his day, and tried his own hand at them based on his knowledge of astrology. He believed the new age would begin perhaps in 1583 or 1584. In some of their later scrying experiments, the angels tell Dee and Kelley that “the tyme of God’s visitation” was supposedly “8.” Dee speculated that this might mean 1588, what seemed to be confirmed in further sessions. This year was already a focal point of widespread apocalyptic expectation across Europe due to various other circulating prophecies (like the one from Regiomontanus). All of this context, the anxiety and anticipation of the day, made the angels' messages about an impending universal transformation feel incredibly timely and divinely orchestrated. Dee likely saw himself, through this angelic guidance, as a key recipient of divine wisdom. That he was meant to help humanity navigate or prepare for these critical end times, perhaps even being heir to the prophetic biblical tradition of Enoch, Elias, Esdras, and John the Apostle.

At first, it seemed that they were more interested in the location of hidden treasure, which they basically pester the angels about endlessly. You may have been broke, but have you ever ignored an angel giving you the secrets of the universe so that you could be lead to buried treasure, asking them to loan you money for a horse? At one point, the angels had to scold them a little bit. Eventually, however, they learned to work the boys. Stringing them along with promises of treasure, like a carrot on a stick, they instead deliver to them the keys of all creation and the material to potentially prompt the apocalypse. These guys are like the Beavis and Butthead of the 16th century. Someone should make a movie about their misadventures. Harold and Kumar go to the angelic realm. 

On March 24th, 1583, the Archangel Raphael granted Kelley his first vision of what would eventually be called the Holy Book of Loagaeth. Edward began to see what he described as a booklet with forty-eight leaves(pages with both front and back), made of gold, and bound together. It appeared as though it were still wet, having been written with fresh blood. The letters and words were unrecognizable, some sort of foreign hieroglyphic alphabet, completely novel. Once Kelley had counted to forty-eight, Raphael confirmed his addition, while also hinting at something mysterious...

"It is finished. One is one (that) neither is, was, or shall be known."

Here he lets us in on a little known fact that there is another leaf, unknown, making the true total 49 - but not only that, that leaf is actually "one," making it the first leaf. Later on this first hidden enigmatic piece of celestial parchment was revealed to Kelley, but in that moment, Raphael informs the boys of its importance..

"It is not to be spoken, but in the time of His own time."

![2nwzzx.gif](/img/user/images/2nwzzx.gif)

Given the theme of the day and its relation to the Book of Revelation, "His own time" is often seen as the promised Second Coming of Christ. That's right, to give you a sense of the importance of what is going down here...the first table was to be reserved for... well I'll let later words from angel Nalvage do the work...

"I find the soul of man hath no portion in this First Table. It is the Image of the Son of God, in the bosom of his father, before all the worlds. It comprehendeth his incarnation, passion, and return to judgment: which he himself, in flesh, knoweth not.**"

In Kelley's second vision of the book, a few days later, he was able to see that each page was made up of an enormous 49x49 grid,  49 columns, and 49 rows. The leaves were filled with letters, "some more than others." It was at this point that Raphael also began to draw out 21 hieroglyphic-esque characters from the book, what would make up the Angelical/Enochian alphabet. Later on, when they are actually revealed the first page, each box is filled with a word instead of a single letter, like the other 48 leaves. Kelley stating here "some more than others" essentially means that he is seeing the full 49 page book in its glory. Later on in the workings, Raphael states "As I have said: the 49 parts of this Book," confirming their premonitions.

So... imagine 98 pages of stuff that looks like this (with the first page even more cluttered)

![loga.png](/img/user/images/loga.png)
	(just wait until the angels hear about sudoku)

In Kelley's third vision of the Holy Book, he was able to catch a glimpse of its cover, which was blue in color, and made from a thin light silk. This title-page read "Amzes naghezes Hardeh"
Kelley reported that these words meant "The Universal Name of Him that created universally be praised and extolled forever." However, there seemed to be a bit of dispute about this, as an Angel named Ave, later in the journals, suggests that the book was entitled "Let Those that Fear God, and Are Worthy, Read."

To skip ahead a bit, the last messenger to greet the gang was Mother of the Angels Galvah. 
Before giving the final page of the book, she settles things...

"Touching the Book, it shall be called Logah: which in your language signifieth Speech from God. Write after this sort       L O A G A E T H: it is to be sounded Logah. This word is of great signification, I mean in respect of the profoundness thereof." 
	(A True and Faithful Relation, p. 19)

On Good Friday March 29th 1583, Kelley began to receive the text of these 49 leaves. The way they went about this... well, first Kelley got into a trance. Then... while staring into his crystal, a "sword of flame" apparently came out of the shewstone and would plunge itself into Kelley's head. It was described "a thing immediately creeping within his head, and in that pang became all in a sweat." This was quite uncomfortable for him, but would ease itself after around 15 minutes, at which point Kelley would be in a state similar to shamanic ecstasy. Here he could read and speak with fluency the strange foreign language within this other-worldly literature, in a somewhat analogous manner to the traditional Christian "speaking in tongues" as a result of invoking the Holy Spirit. After their sessions, the fire would retreat from his skull and Kelley would lose these abilities. 

Archangel Raphael began to deliver the first lines of the first leaf in an arduous and meticulous manner. Remember that this initial 49x49 grid is filled with all words and not letters like the others. He would point to each box with a magical golden rod of his, and then spell out each word letter by letter. Kelley would speak these letters out loud for Dee to record in a painstaking manner. Taking into account both sides, that's a total of 4,800 words. Letter. by. l e t t e r. 

After making it through only 2 lines of the first page, 98 words deep (only 4,702 to go), Dee became concerned that this was going to take forever. The process was so laborious that even Dee, usually patient and pious, couldn’t help but complain. Asking if there was another way they could perhaps go about things, he aired his grievances to the angel Raphael, whom, apparently having little patience for mortal complaints, abruptly withdrew from the sessions. Taking his belongings with him, the vision of the Holy Book suddenly vanished from Kelley's sight as-well. After a little prayer of reconciliation on the part of Dee, Raphael showed back up to lecture the duo. Claiming the request was "inappropriate", Raphael wasn't going to show back up until the whole book was transmitted. He assured them, however, that his office would remain. The revelations from then on came solely as spoken dictation(a voice to Kelley in trance), without the benefit of Raphael’s guiding wand(although it was probably his voice). Dee however, was, after all this trouble, able to get his request granted. The rest of the leaf was transmitted word by word instead of letter by letter. This took much of the workload off their shoulders, but, what came with that, was the sacrifice of having an exact spelling of the remaining words - only the phonetics would remain(which Dee did his best to make precise).

Another thing to be noted, is that this Enochian angelic language was to be read from right to left, similar to Hebrew/Aramaic. This was unique to Western magic, and John Dee had to figure this out himself. Later on he has his suspicion confirmed by Uriel, and then at the very end, Mother of the angels Galvah comes in to instruct Dee to rewrite the entirety of it all in reverse.

"The first leaf (as you call it) is the last of the book. ...  Write the book (after your order) backward, but alter not the form of the letters, I speak in respect of the places."
	A True and Faith and Relation, p. 191

How is it that these tables were meant to be used?
What are we doing crosswords here or something?

Well.... after copying them all out correctly, they are supposedly unlocked or opened using a series of 48 (or 49) calls. The first four of these came through slowly, and backwards, over multiple sessions(but with translations). One of these words, OM, seems to be a possible root for "to understand" or "to know." How'd the Hindu's beat em to this? Then calls 5-18 came through in a single hurried session without any English. The last 30, called the Aethyrs, came through in a single session as-well(being quite short). The first call, for the first table, was given to Dee hidden in plain sight during another session much earlier(a long string of text that ultimately doesn't make much sense). So... starting with the second table (remember the first is saved for Jesus), reciting these new keys, along with the use of the special angelic tools they made earlier, open up the power of the pages and pages of grids. Now the result of all of this isn't exactly clear, but, occultists have worked out that it either corresponds with, or possibly even prompts, the apocalypse. 

Yup.

The Liber Logaeth is said to contain knowledge about the nature of God, the secret nature of the angels, but also, the speech which generated all of creation to come into existence. It was seen as a sort of final revelation for humankind, unifying and perfecting all religions - but also, in so doing, heralding in the apocalypse. The Liber Logaeth is supposed to be the final scripture, John Dee and Edward Kelley being the final prophets, their work, a text containing the divine speech which brought things into being, but also, what would be responsible for the beginning of its annihilation. It is said to contain the 7 seven days of creation, as-well as the dreaded 8th day of judgement.

Dee records the angel Raphael saying of the book that it contains: _"The Mysterie of our Creation, The Age of many years, and the conclusion of the World: and of all things, which are prefixed from the beginning: and are, or shall be to the end of the World."_ (This is from Dee's diaries, specifically the _Mysteriorum Libri Quinque_, detailing the reception of _Liber Loagaeth_).

“What I speak hath not byn reuealed, no not in these last tymes, of the second last world. But I begynne new worldes, new people, new kings, & new knowledge of a new Gouernment.” “New worlds, shall spring of these. New manners: strange men:” “The old ways cease, the new begin.”

At one point, during the transmission of the first key, Nalvage even tries showing John Dee that the book has its own form of gematria going on, by breaking down the word for truth. 

"N (The number must needs go to) the sixth, descending 309.
A The 7th ascending 360.
o The 9th ascending 1000.
o The 13th ascending 1050.
V The 17th ascending 2004. It is Vooan. It may be sounded Vaoan.
NaIvage: Add those last numbers.
Dee: 309
360
1000
]050
2004
4723
They make 4723
Nalvage: It is called the Mystical root in the highest ascendant of trans-
mutation.
Dee: These phrases are dark. When it shall please God they may be
made plain.
Nalvage: It is the square of the Philosophers work.
Dee: You said it was a root.
Nalvage: So it is a root square.
Dee: The square thereof is 22306729 ."

Interesting, so.... 4723 is supposedly the "mystical root in the highest ascendant transmutation?"
and also "the square of the Philosophers work?"

Not only did the journey begin with a journey centered around the number 47 and 23, but also, the phaoroh dude I have mentioned a few times, that man was born June 23 47 B.C..

![Pasted image 20250610051931.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250610051931.png)

The "language" of _Liber Loagaeth_ was not translated by the angels for Dee, unlike the later Enochian Calls. Its dense, patterned tables of letters appeared chaotic and incomprehensible. Dee himself wrote that the first leaf shown to him was so mysterious that it seemed to contain all knowledge but in an unformed, ungraspable state.

In 1587, while Dee and Kelley were living in Třeboň (in what is now the Czech Republic), Kelley claimed to have received a communication from angels named Madimi and Ill. This angelic message reportedly instructed Dee and Kelley to **exchange wives** as a means of furthering their philosophical and spiritual partnership. John Dee, however hesitant, seemed to be able to confirm that this was the order. Could this have been a test of sorts, or had they been working with demons/fallen angels all along? Dee from all counts drove this man for hours and hours, scrying as though he were an addicted, deranged task master. Perhaps this was a sort of 
"fuck you," "I'm done with this," so that he could get  back to his alchemy work, potentially his sanity. Frustrated and going crazy, could he have made up this fake command in hopes that Dee would get angry and fire him? 
"Angels like....totally told me that we have to exchanges wives or whatever.... and like..... share everything else too. Sorry man, I don't make the rules, but you've gotta let me rail your wife."

livin la liber logaeth

Following through, it seems their lives took quite a quality decline, and the two could no longer work with one another. It is even hypothesized that the child Dee's wife gave birth to.... around 9 months after this period.... may have actually been Edward Kelley's(although John raised little Theodore with love as if he were one of his own). A pioneer in the world of scrying and swinging, it seems that golden coins may not have been the only form of booty which Edward was interested in. 

Could a malicious order have been slipped in there as a test to see if they have the ability to defy it and prove their righteousness? Could their elevated state have opened them to a higher dimensional field in which this negative influence may have the capacity to enter, and the continuance of such work would demand a consciousness that is immune to these devilish prompts to survive? In [[The Ra Contact\|The Ra Contact]], during channeling sessions, it seems the group faced off against a negatively oriented 5th dimensional entity which would attempt to cause as much chaos and issues as possible, with the intention of separating the group and stopping the working. 

It's a matter of debate as to whether Dee and Kelley fully understood the implications of the system they were receiving, or the ultimate intentions of the spiritual entities they were communicating with. Dee approached the work with piety and a desire for wisdom, to benefit mankind. Kelley was a more complex and perhaps reluctant participant at times. Some theorize that the two were essentially the instru­ments where­by the rit­u­al for­mu­la for ini­ti­at­ing the apoc­a­lypse would be plant­ed in the midst of human­i­ty. If the apoc­a­lypse were to take place, and if it were nec­es­sary for human beings to open the gates of the Watch­tow­ers.... before that could all occur, the angels first had to instruct man on the cor­rect method for open­ing the gates. Here, hiding in plain sight, it would sit like a ticki­ng occult time bomb, wait­ing for some powerful magi­cian, possibly the second coming of Christ, through divinely orchestrated guid­ance, to work it. Some see the theurgic operation comparable to opening the seven seals from the Book of Revelation.

"Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. 2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” 3 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. 4 I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 5 Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
	Revelation 5:1-5

Dee nev­er received the sig­nal to con­duct the Apoc­a­lypse work­ing in his life­time. There is no evidence that either him nor Kelley engaged in the material which they brought forth. 
That was to be reserved for anoth­er cen­tu­ry and anoth­er man.... 

I'm sorry guys.
I didn't realize what I had gotten myself into until it was too late. 
But I may have accidentally started the apocalypse. 

I had discovered this author during my studies of Kundalini. His book on the subject was pretty good, it synthesized much what surrounded the topic in a single location. He had another book which preceded it, discussing the link between the Eastern Kundalini and the Western Mystery Traditions. 
	https://www.amazon.com/MAGUS-KUNDALINI-Complete-Spirituality-Mysteries/dp/177706080X

Towards the end of the book it contained the Enochian calls/keys. I had begun going through these perhaps 6 months prior, just 1 of them every once and a while. I didn't really place much importance on the calls, and was not really educated on the subject at all - other than the fact that I associated it with Enoch - and it must somehow be related to kundalini. As I began to go through the calls, it became clear to me that there may be a level to this which was in-fact legitimate. In the days or two proceeding, I could catch my pupils in the mirror, dilated as though I were on some sort of drug. I would feel incredibly intense emotions. I considered it to be potentially sparking activations of some kind of metaphysical nature beyond logical understanding within my subconscious. I was somewhat used to this, having been into kundalini yoga/other systems for the last few years. During this time I had begun experimenting with the content of numerous different spiritual systems, like the 72 Shem Angels, special Sanskrit chants, etc. so I wasn't able to directly pinpoint all of my experience to the calls. However, I remember just how profoundly my spiritual journey began to accelerate when I heard the word Enoch from my father, in random conversation, during one of the most intense emotional moments of my life, years ago, which activated me, as described in [[Prequel𓂀/0. Sequence of Events\|0. Sequence of Events]], something I would not forget. 

![Pasted image 20250524162955.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Pasted%20image%2020250524162955.png)
The phonetics of a certain word within these calls, "Babage," (which seems to mean South)  
emphasized a pronunciation of "Bah-Bah-Jee."

This held particular importance for me because it seemed to parallel [[Babaji\|Babaji]] - a being whom I believed had reached out, made contact with, and began to guide me from a distance(around 3 years ago now). I perceived this individual to perhaps be an immortal being that lived within the Himalayan mountains, and given the history of the subject, that he guides prophets, myself potentially in the beginning stages of a new career.

As-well, as I began to study more deeply into the topic, is seemed that Nalvage
is somewhat similar to Nagaraj, which is an alternate name for Babaji... or according to Sri M, a being whom Babaji was at-least in contact with. Just something I found interesting...

![Pasted image 20250529172646.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250529172646.png)

I should note there is a growing theory that scholars have begun to formulate over recent years... that John Dee simple made all of this up. Some of his notes hint that he knew others would eventually look back and glance through his grand archive of work. The only logical conclusion which investigators would be forced to come to, is that Dee's nuts. Playing the long game, all the way from the 15th century, here we have stumbled upon the worlds first Deez Nutz, etching its place in the records of human history from the celestial kingdom itself. *goteeeeem*

The Enochian magic system was later adopted into the work of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This work was later adopted and revised by the worlds most famous occultist Aleister Crowley. He is largely responsible for the surge of popularity in this otherwise mostly forgotten and neglected renaissance work. Aleister Crowley, who identified himself as "The Beast" 666 from the Book of Revelation, worked through the entire system and reorganized it. He famously scried the final 30 keys, the Aethyrs{backwards from the system Dee received), on a trip through the Northern Algerian desert in 1909. Well, actually, he began the first two keys during the year of 1900 in Mexico, but ultimately drifted away from them. During this intermission, he "channeled" his most famous and important piece of work, "The Book of the Law." 

The entire process began on the 16th of March in 1904, when Crowley was attempting the "Bornless Ritual" with his wife, Rose, while spending the night in the Kings Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza. On an extended honeymoon, he was attempting to "shew the Sylphs," aka show the air-spirits/fairies, to his new wife(a thoughtful gift). She was not able to perceive anything, but did enter into a bit of a trance, repeatedly saying "They're waiting for you!" Rose lacked having much interest in the occult or magic, and so, didn't think much of it. However, two days later, after Crowley performed an invocation to Thoth, she seemed to pop back into mediumship mode and dial in a bit as to who it was waiting for Crowley, revealing their identity by name.... Horus. 

Crowley was a bit skeptical, not sure if she was pulling his leg or whatnot, and asked her numerous questions about Horus. Rose passed his interrogations and was able to answer, accurately, multiple questions, supposedly without having any prior study of the subject. As part of his testing, Crowley took his wife on a romantic stroll through the Bulaq museum, located in Cairo Egypt. Here he quizzed her, asking Rose to point to images of Horus. Crowley was amused as they walked through the display of artwork all around them, his wife missing numerous opportunities to point to imagery which would validate her claims. However, the two went upstairs and, from across the room, she correctly pointed at and identified the falcon headed figure on the stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu. Not only was she able to prove herself, but also, in a profoundly uncanny twist of events, it seemed that the item she was pointing at was catalogued under inventory number 666... a number of profound significance for Crowley(later changed moving museums). 

![666tablet 1.png](/img/user/images/666tablet%201.png)

Aleister immediately commissioned a curator at the museum to help translate the inscriptions into French/English. Eventually, Rose revealed that her "informant" was not Horus himself, but actually his messenger, Aiwass, a secret chief of a very senior celestial grade. Soon after the translation was finished, on April 7th 1904(4-7-1904), Rose informed her husband that he was to go and sit in his temple at exactly noon on April 8th, 9th, and 10th. He was to write down everything that he heard until exactly 1 o'clock, and then leave. Crowley followed these orders, and on the appointed hour, of the appointed day, at the appointed location, sat before his temple table with pen and paper in hand. When the clock struck 12, a voice began to speak to Crowley from over his left shoulder. The voice was "of deep timbre, musical and expressive," and began to relay spiritual dictation which Aleister found difficult to keep pace with. At exactly 1:00, the voice stopped, and so did Crowley. At the end of the three days, what was written were all three sections of what would be the central Magus of the Thelemic system, what was titled, "The Book of the Law." Later, in discussion with Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs, Crowley was introduced to the idea that “Aiwaz” might be the proper name of the god of the Yezidis, a Kurdish religious minority historically accused of being devil worshippers. Their chief divine figure, **Melek Taus**, also known as **Shaytan** or **Shaitan**, is associated with the Islamic Satan (Iblis). They embraced the then-popular but now disputed theory that the Yezidis worship Satan as a misunderstood or enlightened being, very similar to some of the Nag Hammadi Gnostics(who viewed the snake in the Garden as a messenger of the divine). This interpretation influenced Crowley to equate Aiwaz with Lucifer, not in the Christian sense of evil, but as the liberating, rebellious force—an archetype of spiritual independence and enlightenment.

Occultists say that it is normal for one to leave certain workings, returning back to their life, perhaps experiencing certain initiations, before they are called to return back and finish what they may actually now be ready for. This seemed to be the case for Crowley, whom after starting the aethyrs, was drawn to The Book of Law, his most important work. The first two aethyrs he scried were just prequels to a much larger picture that Crowley began to see. He came back to finish the rest during what was originally supposed to be a recreational trek through the desert. A trip with his friend, lover and student Victor Neuburg, the journey was originally just for enjoyment. However, Crowley had brought all of the items necessary, and found himself inspired, to undertake a scrying aether journey through the desert. He would sit under the stars, and with Victor, report his visions. By the time Aleister had gotten down to the final 9 aethyrs, he received guidance to recite Surah 112 of the Koran 1001 times per day, bowing in-between each recitation(what must have been physically grueling). The visions that came through Crowley's scrying sessions showed up in an apocalyptic, very King's Jamesian style manner(reminisent of what he grew up around). These visions are what would make up his book, published in 1911, titled "The Vision and the Voice." 

Aleister Crowley's _The Vision and the Voice_ and _The Book of the Law_ are his two most significant works, and that which forms the cornerstone of Thelemic philosophy. The Book of Law declares the end of the Aeon of Osiris (associated with patriarchal religions like Christianity) and the dawn of the Aeon of Horus, marked by spiritual autonomy and direct communion with the divine. This was seen to liberate humanity from submission to external gods, replacing them with self-directed spiritual growth. A time of the "crowned and conquering child", symbolic for youthful potential unburdened by past limitations. Crowley was heralding in a new era which would require individuals to reject herd mentality and embrace their own divine nature, dismantling outdated religious structures in favor of individualized spiritual paths.

The Vision and the Voice is filled with imagery that Crowley experienced utilizing the Enochian system of magic, scrying the aethyrs, which ultimately represented and described the transition of the world into this new age of Horus. Through a series of visionary journeys, Crowley encountered powerful archetypes, spiritual trials, and revelations that both illustrated and deepened the themes introduced in The Book of the Law. Here the aspirant is confronted with the dissolution of the ego, the crossing of the Abyss, and the embrace of one’s True Will—experiences that embody the spiritual autonomy and self-realization at the heart of the new era. Together, these two works offer both the declaration and the experiential unfolding of Thelema’s revolutionary vision for humanity.

Now, why does this matter? 
Well, if I am that Pharoah fella,
it should be noted, that his mother, 
Cleopatra, viewed herself as an incarnation of Isis,
and her son, Pizza Pizza VX,
was viewed as an incarnation of Horus.
This was common for Pharaohs and queens of Egpyt,
but they took it to another level.
Here's a statue Cleopatra had made of her kid being
overshadowed by an enormous falcon,
associated with Horus, to prove it to you.

I found some excerpts from Aleister Crowleys Vision and the Voice, specically, "The Cry of the 14th Aethyr, Which is Called UTI", to be interesting.

"And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake. The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. On his Forehead is a star, but all about him is darkness, and the crying of beasts. And there are lamps moving in the darkness.

And the Angel says: Depart! For thou must invoke me only in the darkness. Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the Mystery of UTI. For the Mystery thereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sight of the sun.

Therefore I withdraw myself. 

December 3, 2:50-3:15 p.m."
....
around 6 and a half hours go by until around 9:45 p.m...

"The Angel re-appears.

The blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, so oppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would be like bright light beside it.

His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates of Understanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg? Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.

I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light. I am the sightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with desolation. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the darkness of the earth is ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but the darkness of the soul is utter blackness... "

The famous axioms which sum up the entirety of Thelema...

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
along with
"Love is the law, love under will."

The final closing passage of The Book of the Law..

which I had actually listened to 3 months before any of this began to take place...
(it actually disturbed me, towards the end it said only to listen once... and never again, BET!)

"The ending of the words is the Word Abrahadabra. The Book of the Law is Written and Concealed. Aum. Ha"

Now, the significance that this word was important to Aleister Crowley, or perhaps whatever he was channeling - so much so that it is made as this final closing statement, will take a little bit of explaining.... 

![wizard-conjure-cylinder-magicians-hat-600nw-2292822833.jpeg](/img/user/images/wizard-conjure-cylinder-magicians-hat-600nw-2292822833.jpeg)

In July of 2022 I became part of a little collective of producers with a few people I had met on SoundCloud. Randomly someone had commented on a track I uploaded, which otherwise had little to no traction, and we began to message back and forth. Things went off from there and we decided to join forces. A discord group was created that we would all be active in - livestreaming ourselves making beats, sharing different sounds we made, goofing and gaffing - etc.  The name was Deep Violet, an idea I had from the crown chakra being purple, and also the hex-code of the color being 330066(what would be the url) which seemed kinda cool. I didn't really know much about chakras at this point, but that the crown was the highest one, the most transcendent. I'm not sure I had any idea that it was associated with ceremonial magic either. Aleister Crowley is generally considered the worlds most famous ceremonial magician of all time, and in his book 777 states "The deep violet is episcopal."

These guys were good at making beats. I eventually had to stop because I could tell my path was going to have to be something else. The talent gap was too in my face, and I was already 5 years deep into producing - it was going to take a lot of energy for me to keep up if I wanted to. At the time I had the vision for this website brewing in my head, already having purchased the URL, but with no idea how it would all eventually play out. I didn't expect to uncover any past life stuff, but simply wanted to talk about spiritual topics I was passionate about. I was in the early part of my DopenessOnDeck47 phase as outlined in ---> [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]. 

Now, I didn't remember the particular detail we will look at here until having already finished my entire piece of writing, this being one of the final additions, but looking back at the archives, something quite peculiar has occurred. I'm not sure where I had learned this, but around 3 years ago, I must have come across some sort of little expose on the original Abracadabra word. Come on now, you know it, the phrase you've hear wizards/witches saying in movies all your life? I probably had found some random blog/social media post late at night and discovered that it had roots in old practice. I jokingly 'cast a spell' in chat, just messing around and being a bit hyperbolic, but used the word to "manifest" an outrageous thing into existence - not really believing it would actually do anything(0 education on the subject). The most popular producers in the scene were nowhere near 10,000 followers, even today 3 years later, it was quite a baselessly hopeful and utterly grandiose projection, but I was trying to generate hype it seems. We didn't put together any more than a few releases, perhaps getting to around 30-40 followers, but had a lot of fun over the summer. All of our sounds definitely evolved. Two of them went on to sorta pop off a little bit after putting in an immense amount of work - [nic](https://soundcloud.com/nic200) and [Erebasu](https://soundcloud.com/erebasu). They were both active 24/7 grinding, and some of the more creative people I have across. 

![Pasted image 20250731030223.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250731030223.png)

Erebasu and I would stay up late till 4 AM video chatting and talking ridiculous dreams about our future (his Discord username Arivahoo in the photo). I had no idea that his name in Greek, Erebus, represented the primordial god of darkness, or son of Chaos, sometimes the underworld itself. Seemed like a stand up guy to me. I haven't talked to him other than a few messages in a long time, maybe around a year and a half at this point. Our friendship was sure a lot better than the last one I developed on that website. 

There was a girl whose SoundCloud DM's I slid into around 4-5 years ago. I really liked the songs she was reposting and she made cool little mixes. Profile pic was kinda cute, I decided to shoot a shot - a hail Mary if you will. None of the girls I came across in person ever had similar tastes in auditory aesthetics, so I thought maybe her personality was similar to mine(which is quite weird). She responded and we messaged back and forth a few times - myself trying to lay down the charm. I even learned how to make a mix of my own favorite songs to speak her language. It wasn't long until I addressed her with the title SoundCloud gf as a joke, not necessarily being 100% serious, but displaying some intention. She replied with something along the lines of having a boyfriend. Looking back - I'm not sure if she was just trying to pump the brakes on a random internet stranger that was being a bit fast and overbearing, playing a little hard to get and slowing it down for a second, or if she was legitimately disclosing to me that she was already involved with someone else. She may have been flat out not interested and I was looking like a complete weirdo. Either way, I was an optimistic young lad, and my mind perceived her to be engaging with me in a way that was meant to inspire the belief there was some sort of opening. Interest could have been somewhat peaked, but I was going to have to proceed forward unbothered by her comment until she see's I'm not as needy as I may be appearing, at which point, I either pass the test or possibly replace the boyfriend(with time). It was here I tried to snap back to my senses. No more love story across space and time - how much weed have I been smoking? If this girl wasn't already into me from the 10 messages and 1 mixtape I have sent her on this music listening app, regardless of whether or not she has a very unique taste which I can appreciate, I don't think its worth any further effort. She could be fulfilled with someone that's a better match for all I know. If I was going to try and begin a long distance relationship(why would you even want to do that) with a stranger(a way to pickily avoid wonderful girls already into me in real life), and there wasn't this sudden instant recognition that my personality was a match, maybe it wasn't, maybe I should let it go. Sure, "If he really wanted to he would," and at-least attempt to scream boyfriend shmoyfriend before rallying to battle at the gates of her heart, but she said she had one... lets back up and take this opportunity to undo whatever I was attempting to begin here. An insecure part of myself, irregardless of my active desire to now let it fizzle out, couldn't look past the idea of any sort of potential rejection towards my personality(even though this was a terrible idea), coming online to play dignity defense. I was going to make it clear that I was a very cool guy, just in-case, because you know, maybe I looked like a bit of a 'simp' there for a second(narcissistic insecurity). I talked about how epic and mind expanding doing psychedelics like MDMA, LSD, and DMT was - Swag Swag SWAG - propping myself up as too much of an enlightened wizard to care whether or not she liked me. I even offered to sell to her if she wanted, to ship things through the mail, something I've never actually done before and was hoping to not actually be taken up on(and likely didn't even have the resources for). Now I looked like a mysterious 'bad-boy', irresistible to the teenage girl brain. Hook line and sinker, she will see that I was actually her ideal boyfriend (while I'm hiding across the country delicately controlling frame), whether or not she has one already(and whether or not I even wanted to peruse things with her at-all). By the time it all lands, it will have been too late. I tried to be nice(co-dependent), but ya'know, girls are attracted to the asshole... If you need me, my manic self will be somewhere else... 

bye now 👋

1 year later, she attacked her mother and burnt down their $3.3 million mansion, a house that had been featured in the magazine “Artful Living” in 2016. When the emergency crews arrived, she seemed out of it and told them she heard a demon speak to her. Her mother told investigators that she had fallen asleep after watching part of a movie with her, and when she woke up, smelt gasoline. Going downstairs to investigate, she found her daughter with a lit candle on the floor. After asking what she was doing, she supposedly attacked her and then chased her with said candle. Successfully running away, her mother managed to get to one of their balconies in order to call 911. She then tried to climb down from the balcony, at which point she was allegedly pulled down and attacked by again. 

Afterwards, she was arrested and charged with first degree arson and domestic assault. Once things went to trial, she was acquitted of all charges. Her lawyer said "Ms. Schultz was seriously and genuinely mentally ill at the time and the law is clear - one is not guilty if one can't appreciate the consequences of one's actions."  Thankfully, "She is fortunate to come from a very loving family who understand that she was not responsible for her actions that night." He said that she "has struggled with some mental health issues for a long time, so the family was aware she had some problems. I don't know why they got so severe when they did."

I was clueless that any of this had occurred until months after my kundalini training, at-least another year following the incident. At some point, having heard so much about them from different books/youtubers/conspiracies, I decided to watch a lecture on the Gnostic worldview. It should be noted that “Gnostic” is best understood as a modern scholarly category that covers many diverse sects of early Christianity. There was no single unified Gnostic religion — instead, multiple movements shared certain mythic themes but differed widely in detail. The Apocryphon of John is viewed as foundational and one of the best sources to begin studying Sethian Gnosticism, being one of the earliest systematic, totalizing Christian theological narratives. Also referred to as The Secret Book/Revelation of John, it is dated to around 100-185 AD, and very well developed for the time period. This text ends very hopeful, contrary to how people typically view Gnostics, and the ideas contained within are incredibly impressive from a philosophical, spiritual, and theological viewpoint. Until the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library in 1945, our only sources for understanding Gnosticism were the writings of those who made them out to be evil heretics, the proto-orthodox church fathers of the second, third, and fourth centuries.

In this particular Gnostic cosmology, the ultimate reality is something called the Monad—a single, perfect source beyond time, space, and form. This is the supreme, unknowable, and ineffable God, the ultimate source of all being, often described as the "One," the "Absolute," or the "Invisible Spirit". From the Monad emerges _Nous_ — divine mind or understanding. At first, this is simply awareness turned inward, the mind contemplating itself in perfect stillness. This act of contemplation gives rise to _Ennoia_, the First Thought, known as Barbelo. She is the perfect image and counterpart of the Invisible Spirit, sometimes seen as a divine feminine principle, and at other times, the androgynous “Mother-Father” who contains all archetypes and possibilities within herself. In some descriptions, Barbelo is like the vast mirror in which the Monad sees itself for the first time. At a certain point, thought begins to reflect upon itself. This is a new kind of generative act, and from it comes their child, the Autogenes or Self-Generated One, the Self-Begotten, also called the Christ. Thought thinking itself. Autogenes/Christ is an Aeon, a divine emanation from the mother Barbelo, the first emanation of the Monad(Father), and is considered the Son in the divine family structure.

![Pasted image 20250913160611.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250913160611.png)

What happened next in the process was that Christ asked to be given companions. The Invisible Spirit consented, and thus, Christ expanded. Outwardly now come the four lights, which are archangels, or a kind of archangels, along with 12 Aeons. Normally when we think of Aeons, we think of time, but in Gnosticism, it is like time and space reflecting/expanding outwardly, and then reflecting back to the One. This expansion through space and time from the One into the many is a way for the One to multiply and see itself in various perfect forms. The Gnostics describe this divine realm as being surrounded by a luminous water, in which, the One witnesses itself as different reflections in the watery light. Each of the four lights reign over 3 of the 12 Aeons, which are like angels, and have names which describe their qualities. These qualities are all reflective of the heart/mind.

![Pasted image 20250810114330.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250810114330.png)

After this process, now Christ is a new form of mind, able to see, experience, and know himself in these various forms. This is the Pleroma, or the upper Aeons, the realm of divine fullness where the Monad’s emanations exist in perfect balance. They appear in male–female pairs called _syzygies_, which together, with one another's consent, generate further Aeons through a harmonious process of union. Sophia (_Wisdom_) is one such Aeon, traditionally positioned at the outermost limit of the Pleroma and paired with the Christ Aeon as her syzygy. 

"and his (Christs) consort is the great Sophia who, from the first, was destine for him in union." 
-Sophia of Jesus Christ 101:15

Now in the mythic narrative, things take a dramatic twist in what is called The Fall of Sophia. 

![Pasted image 20250913161002.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250913161002.png)

"Now, Sophia, who is the wisdom of afterthought and who constitutes an eternal realm, conceived of a thought from herself, with the conception of the invisible spirit and foreknowledge. She wanted to bring forth something like herself, without the consent of the spirit, who had not given approval, without her partner and without his consideration. The male did not give approval. She did not find her partner, and she considered this without the spirit’s consent and without the knowledge of her partner. Nonetheless, she gave birth. And because of the invincible power within her, her thought was not an idle thought. Something came out of her that was imperfect and different in appearance from her, for she had produced it without her partner. It did not resemble its mother and was misshapen.

When Sophia saw what her desire had produced, it changed into the figure of a snake with the face of a lion. Its eyes were like flashing bolts of lightning. She cast it away from her, outside that realm so that none of the immortals would see it. She had produced it ignorantly.

She surrounded it with a bright cloud and put a throne in the middle of the cloud so that no one would see it except the holy spirit, who is called the mother of the living. She named her offspring Yaldabaoth."

This is the beginning of 'the fall', not just of Sophia, but also of humanity, and the entire cosmos. Yaldabaoth then goes on to become the 'Demiurge,' or the 'Archigenetor', creating for himself a tarnished evil dualistic replica of the upper aeons - the lower worlds... 

"This is the first archon who took a great power from his mother. And he removed himself from her and moved away from the places in which he was born. He became strong and created for himself other aeons with a flame of luminous fire which (still) exists now. And he joined with his arrogance which is in him and begot authorities for himself."

The authorities which Yaldabaoth creates are called the 'Archons,' what in Greek means rulers. There are 12 of these different Archons, and each created seven powers for themselves, and each of these powers created six angels (or demons) for themselves. This hierarchical structure results in 365 subordinate demons or angels—one surrounding us for each day of the year. The archons then rule over us through the influence of the 7 spheres of the planets. This is where we are situated at, for these Sethian Gnostics, the entire cosmos that we see with our eyes is in-fact a demonic creation. 

**"This is the number of the angels: together they are 365. They all worked on it until, limb for limb, the natural and the material body was completed by them"**. The Apocryphon then goes on to provide an extensively long and meticulous catalog of demons assigned to individual body parts, including fingers, toes, various organs, bones, and even nails. Additionally, there are four chief demons that govern the fundamental psychic passions
: Ephememphi (pleasure), Yoko (desire), Nenentophni (grief), and Blaomen (fear).


the Gnostic understanding that **time itself is a trap**, and that our physical existence is synchronized with and controlled by these malevolent forces. Every day of the year, every part of the human body, exists under the dominion of these entities, making escape seem impossible without divine intervention.
In Gnosticism, the savior is a "revealer," the one who passed through time and comes in to expose all of this. Not only do they reveal the nature of our creation, but they also show our path back, mapping out the journey for the souls ascent to the One again. In many Gnostic systems, Sophia and Christ form a divine syzygy (paired emanation), with Christ often sent to redeem Sophia's error and restore cosmic balance. 

Abraxas, whose name in Greek gematria equals exactly 365 (Α=1 + Β=2 + Ρ=100 + Α=1 + Σ=200 + Α=1 + Ξ=60 = 365), represents the "Great Archon" of the 365 spheres in Basilidian Gnosticism. 
The etymological connection to "abracadabra" is well-documented. According to scholarly sources, "abracadabra" is derived from Abraxas, described as "a cabbalistic formula derived from the name of the supreme god of the Basilidan gnostics, containing the number 365, the number of the days of the year, and of the heavens, and of the spirits emanating from the god Abraxas". This magical word represents the invocation of the complete cosmological hierarchy that the Gnostics believed enslaved humanity. Carl Jung on Abraxas from _The Red Book_:

> _Hard to know is the deity of Abraxas. Its power is the greatest, because man perceiveth it not. From the sun he draweth the summum bonum highest good; from the devil the infimum malum lowest evil; but from Abraxas life, altogether indefinite, the mother of good and evil._
> 
> _Smaller and weaker life seemeth to be than the summum bonum; wherefore is it also hard to conceive that Abraxas transcendeth even the sun in power, who is himself the radiant source of all the force of life._
> 
> _Abraxas is the sun, and at the same time the eternally sucking gorge of the void, the belittling and dismembering devil._
> 
> _The power of Abraxas is twofold; but ye see it not, because for your eyes the warring opposites of this power are extinguished._

The girl from SoundCloud was named Sophia. I wonder what she has been up to, I thought. Looking up her name, I found the news article that filled in the details, and my brain felt like it short-circuited. Here I was, having had my own sort of psychotic break (where I now thought that I may be Jesus), learning that in this ancient, 'heretical' Christian sect, the material world was seen as the kingdom of a false god, a system that traps a fallen goddess of wisdom named Sophia. I went to go reminisce about some weird situation from years ago, and stumbled into a Gnostic horror story which played itself out in the real life world with a multi-million dollar budget. 
 
 whaaatttttt iiiiissssss gggggooooooiiiiiinnnnnngggggggg oooooooonnnnnnnnnnn. 

Was I to blame here? Could I have influenced this girl to dive headfirst into the depths of the psychedelic realm?  If she did, and if it was because of me, did I cause the mansion to burn? At the end of the day, I don't know. It is a possibility though. It's also possible that she never even thought about me more than 5 minutes and could have been on a train to that destination already. I take the experience as an opportunity to become more conscious of how I may affect other people. In the worst case scenario, she tried to follow me into Wonderland and wasn't able to handle it. I never considered the fact that I could have that type of influence on someone else.

I was able to find her new SoundCloud..... "IN YOUR ORBIT" with the planet [[Saturn\|Saturn]]....

Later that night, still this first time on Adderall(5/4/25), right after my conversation with the Angel of Death, I discovered that a music producer I was a fan of had dropped a new project(on 5/3/25). My old purple bud Erebasu, it seems, was also featured in the production credits. While listening to it, I found myself navigating to the artists twitter. I scrolled a bit and saw that they were making fun of a SoundCloud group which made their members do a ritual in order to join. 

![Pasted image 20250519231003.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250519231003.png)

I thought that was funny and wanted to see what sort of music people like that were creating. I went, looked it up, and glanced through some of what they had. It was thematically dark content, somewhat in alignment with how the night was already proceeding. One of the artists apart of this collective was 2 Shanez. This was particularly alluring for me because my name is Shane, and I've had the original gamertag Two Chainz on Xbox live since I was 11 or 12 - able to pass as the rapper in the world of Halo and Call of Duty lobbies my entire life. I made many middle aged African American friends during that time I was barely in middle school, and I have to say, everyone treated me with a tremendous amount of respect. I was the original 2 Shanez, but it seemed that someone had picked up on the swagger I developed in the ether and attempted to create a rap career out of it. Looking through their songs, they weren't necessarily that good, some had nice beats, but the vocals... I wasn't necessarily a fan of. 

Eventually I got to this one. 

![Pasted image 20250525034127.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250525034127.png)

Does that not look like some kind of angel of death? 4,444 Likes. 214 comments and 214 reposts.
Come on, this was a bit spooky, myself still riding out this Adderall, it felt so... predetermined? 
Notable lyrics,
"For me to tell you how I feel better pop my addy (pop that addy)  
And i feel that they sleepin on me" 
Part of the main chorus of the song is talking about "my chain," and the night prior, my brother was showing me a gold chain that he had thoroughly regretted spending 7k on.

Unfortunately, further research revealed that things didn't end up working out for poor 2 Shanez. The ****ᶜᵒᵘᵍʰ**** ᵖᵒˢᵉʳ ****ᶜᵒᵘᵍʰ****  artist is now facing life in prison for murder. 
I don't know if this was about him or not,
it wasn't me(although perhaps I've repressed the memory),
and I'm not sure how many white children named Shane have embraced this pseudonym, 
but in my investigations,
I came across this... 

![Pasted image 20250520003116.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250520003116.png)

I was almost done here but ended up stumbling upon an old Facebook profile I had forgotten about. While in middle school, somebody created an account called "Too Chanez" and added a bunch of people from the educational establishment. 

![Pasted image 20250813004112.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250813004112.png)

My friends knew I had the gamertag Two Chainz, but I wasn't sure what to think. Pretty sure I questioned them all and could tell that they honestly had nothing to do with it. If they were lying to me about this that would have been hilarious, but I genuinely don't think they were. Is somebody else in the school impersonating me as a joke, or is there someone nearby that is coincidentally into this meme enough to create a Facebook account for it? Everybody pointed their finger towards me, and for a while there, it was all I heard about in the hallways. 

![Pasted image 20250813004857.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250813004857.png)

Not only did this character look like it was me, but they talked like me as-well. I was an avid user of the term "ooh kill em" as I unleashed extensive amounts of drippy drip drip around the 8th grade function. Who broke the faucet? Was this some sort of apocalyptic mantra I began at a young age, destined from birth? Things weren't looking good for me. 

![Pasted image 20250813010107.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250813010107.png)

If you or anybody you know has information that can help us figure this out and find who the imposter was, please contact me. Anything that can help us inch closer to the truth would be met with infinite gratitude, and perhaps when I have the resources, a substantial monetary reward. To clear my name on this matter would mean the world. 

The next day, after my initial first Adderall experience, on May 5th, I went to the store and entered conversation with someone I had became friends with that worked there. Eventually they were called to the register and told me they'd see me over there. I finished shopping and navigated over to the open stand they were posted at. We talked about a smoked gouda quesadilla which they had created earlier that week, how the idea for it was inspired by first recommending the tasty dairy product to a customer(give and you shall receive). Before you know it, they were done scanning my haul, and the total was $27.77. An accident of some kind happened, and the employee discount button was pressed by the slip of a finger(20%), and my new total came down to $22.22. Checking the receipt, it seemed that the glitch ended up creating a $5.55 discount. You can do the math yourself, the perfection of this is specific sequence of numbers is beyond my comprehension. I am not certain how many other combinations would elicit repeating numerals in the same manner... (Blurred for privacy reasons) 

![receiptstore.png|400](/img/user/images/receiptstore.png)

My brother and I both decided to do Adderall again in our gardening session the next weekend, 
I mean, there's a lot to get to if we've only got 4 years left. It was Mothers Day weekend, an occasion which our Mother was out of town for, so we finished the night by taking our Grandmother to dinner at Panera Bread. 
I checked the receipt.
How interesting...

On that night, the last time I probably ever take Adderall, Two Shane'z came face to face and were conversing with one another. Not only that, but I am pretty sure it was a girl - something I had never seen before in my life, except for a friend I had in the past that spelt it with a y (Shayne). She was also kinda cute(or so at least I thought in my impaired state), and for a brief moment I thought - could this somehow be my other half?? 😂😂 There was already a lot of magic going on here, was this How I Met Your Mother? At the end of time, Two Shane'z come together.... I was going through a pretty profound Sade phase as-well, and sitting waiting for our food, "Smooth Operator" began to play in the background. Unfortunately, I have to admit, she was probably a biiiiit too young to be any sort of match for me - some girl at 'just out of high school' age, but it was funny watching this fantasy play itself out in my head. Overall, I think having the exact same name would probably be a bit too much; labels would become useless, it'd be confusing in group conversations, and the forgery that she would be able to pull off later down the line could leave me bankrupt.

June 20th

As I was digesting it all, I began to think that this could have potentially just be a grand puzzle, my own wild angelic goose chase, whose purpose was in getting me to seriously look at and learn more about Enochian Magic. I also developed a much greater understanding of the world of esotericism and the occult from studying the life of the worlds most famous occultist - something I was going to have to get around to at some point. As-well, due to the fact that Aleister Crowley's death was in 1947, and the instructions for him to begin channeling "The Book of the Law" were given to him by his wife on April 7th, bringing in the Age of Horus (lil Caesar), I believed the situation may have doubled as the uncovering of another past identity. I already had a lot of 777's show up a few months prior, associated with my mother of all people, described in [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]. Being the potential reincarnation of Aleister Crowley, and therefore this 666 "The Great Beast" character - is not something I am necessarily excited to jump into. I had quite a bit of internal resistance to the idea, and although it would be an alluring identity to take on (worlds most famous occultist) - the guy seemed like a bit of a weirdo. Part of me was understanding that the reputation around Aleister was perhaps inflated by fearful Christians and whatnot, something he embraced and fed into as an OG troll, but still, I didn't really want to identify with the man. There are some suspect things he has stated in journals and been recorded doing, perhaps even killing multiple people. I must note, however, that this is all taking place only a few months after the potential uncovering of myself as this Sabbatai Zevi fella, the great "False messiah" of 1666. The heretical theology behind Sabbatai Zevi, as-well, seems to align exactly with Aleister Crowley's life. Two gentleman both associated with 666, looked at as false bringers of truth by the larger world. Becoming more and more conscious of the potential merit behind this link, I began to teeter into this state of feeling like I was "The Beast," and didn't really like it, even if it had nothing to do with your typical evangelical Christian perspective. It was a bit icky. All I could focus on was all the bad I have ever done in my life, plopped to the forefront of my mind, starting to make me feel like a villain. I know, I've got a shadow like everyone else, but c'mon - I didn't think I was the actual literal antichrist, am I? Perhaps things are so messed up that I couldn't even tell, a dangerous monster that's unaware of his own nature... Next thing you know, I caught a song that was very on theme with that set of emotions at an opportune moment(the day after its release)...

The prior screenshot is from Laker, not the basketball team I was a fan of as a child(Black Mamba RIP), but member of a collective known as Shed Theory. I was introduced to this group from my friend Erebasu while in Deep Violet. I didn't actually like them at first and thought the music they made was reminiscent of a phase that I had already grown out of... but I can't lie... some songs were creative and I enjoyed their unique production style. One of the few I found interesting was Cha-Cha Slide. Looking back, in the music video, for just a brief 2 seconds, there was an overlay of numerous asteroid rocks...

Marlon Dubois is the founding member of Shed Theory, the ~10 or so membered east coast rap crew, emerging from a literal shed on his parents property in the woods of Woodstock, NY. The most popular song to come from any of them is "Gout" by Joeyy, which has amassed nearly 4 million views on YouTube. This song popularized the tag of DJ Smokey, "Shadow Wizard Money Gang," becoming a TikTok meme. After this point, as is the case for many people, they found a difficult time in keeping the views that they were getting. If I may potentially be this Aleister Crowley fella, the ultimate shadow wizard, I would like to suggest one possible potentiality for this inability to catch the wave which was forming. This opens us up to my 'garage' theory, the existence of non-physical astral parasites, the archons of Gnosticism - and the beginning of a new paradigm for the mind. Perhaps this is the apocalypse we are seeing, the death of our ignorance, an opening up to the true nature of things - as weird and offputting as it may sound/be. I hypothesize that potentially, their drug usage and spiritual themes opened them up to astral entity attachments. These then began to cause chaos and tribulations within the group, as-well as in their attempts to expand. Many fan favorites of their collective have decided to leave, and conflict has seemed to cause a tremendous amount of drama with their launch to the public. I can relate to this from directly experiencing it in my own life. Finding myself completely alone and without friends, having lost my entire life savings gambling, I burnt every bridge and opportunity which came my way. There was a force, perhaps just my own self-destructive self, that would figure out a way to destroy anything beautiful that was beginning to bubble for me. It almost seemed to want to push me to death in the isolation of loneliness. Only once I thoroughly fried my brain to the point of psychosis was I able to accurately perceive what was occurring. aha, gotcha! Most don't survive to tell the tale...

(drawn directly after coming home from work , I felt a presence feeding off of my suffering as I was slipping into a place that was fantasizing 'self deletion', even cheering those kinds of ideas on)

![6-C11-BEFF-32-B2-46-F2-9-ABA-0-F0-CCA604-B82.jpg| 400](/img/user/images/6-C11-BEFF-32-B2-46-F2-9-ABA-0-F0-CCA604-B82.jpg)

Now to preface, this is what I looked like at the time. I began to formulate numerous cysts all across my face, at-least 10 or so of them at once. Literal ectoplasm began to leak from my pores. Taking so many drugs, I had completely dissociated from my body. Operating it felt as though I was navigating some strange virtual reality meta-suit, or cooking cuisine in France with a little chef under my hat. I will be the first to admit that I may be speaking from a place of literal psychosis and trauma. I do however personally believe that what I saw was some sort of symbolic way to process what is actually happening in this world. If we take into account the truth that our eyes only pick up about 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum, I think it would be foolish to completely dismiss these things from my garage theory. 

![Pasted image 20250816025651.png| 500](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250816025651.png)
(in researching Shed Theory 'beefs' I searched the names of one of these individuals and clicked the first result. I cringe quite hard watching this but the numbers were nice)

If you check the Shed Subreddit, there are numerous allegations of them scamming fans out of different merch and CD's, leaving them with a bad taste about the group. This may have not been anything malicious, it could have simply be a product of poor management - and themselves too slumped off of opiates/ketamine/whatever to run things right, demonstrating the side effects of entity attachments. There's one example I was able to find where Laker got $160 for a pair of shoes he was advertising on Instagram, and then never shipped them. I do want to note that there was someone saying he went and contacted people to make things right - I'm not trying to wave something from the past over someone to make them feel shame like I'm some holy wonderful person. I worked for Takis at a local basketball competition in my city called Hoopfest, which is perhaps the largest 3v3 basketball event in the nation. Inside of my garage, I still have a cornhole board, and two Taki's banisters that I just couldn't be assed with shipping back to them by the time I was done. This then caused me to lose the opportunity the next year, at which point, I was scrounging quite badly, feeling the monetary consequences. Think of the butterfly effect, and how each one of these individuals could have shared their music with this friend of theirs or that friend, who may have become a fan themselves and showed their friends, etc. The world is trying to bring you up, you yourself are seeing the fruits of immensely difficult labor which often takes years, but the entities sneakily slide in the backdoor to sabotage these efforts. A very exaggerated example to demonstrate the point - imagine you took a man off of skid-row and gave him $1,000,000. This individual likely has no capacity to use this opportunity effectively. The energies running him will continue to run in their same patterns, and if they survive the copious amount of substances they could acquire with such a monetary sum, will be back on the streets shortly - even after being given everything they may need to turn things around. I used to trade crypto and personally found my greatest successes as I deepened further and further into addiction. Now, I wasn't shooting up cocaine in local gas station bathrooms like my brother, but I used marijuana nicotine and psychedelics with a similar fiendishness. It gave me clarity and sharpness, I was able to see patterns and act on them fast enough to profit immensely. Eventually I just started feeling crazy, like I had no control over myself - but hey, even as I become emotionally unhealthy and isolate from all the relationships in my life, we're making money, so I am successful, right? One night I got my balance up +$87,000 in a single night - to $100,000, a feat that took 5 years of study to pull off. Holy shit, I've made it. We could just stop right here. Right as I was about to pull everything out, planning to put it all into a small coin I had researched for hundreds of hours (which in proceeding months went up 1,700%), sabotage. I couldn't resist the greedy feeling that I was some unstoppable money printing genius and went back in to high leverage trading(gambling). Losing a small amount, I began to trade emotionally, and proceeded to burn every. single. penny.

(I think of the example, begin to write about it, go to youtube, and boom)

The entirety of Wolf of Wallstreet, based on a true story, is a demonstration of the same phenomenon in a different world. The collapse of certain morals internally, what Leonardo's character originally came in with, allowed him to be massively successful. Becoming a drug addict, a sex addict, a completely raging lunatic, all of these things, they brought him to the top. What happened, is that the man became miserable, lost everything that he had, and was left empty. Worse than before. The ol' entity 1 2 maneuver. He initiates into these behaviors slowly as he joins rank with the others... 

Drugs are what may have opened up different creative pathways for the Shed in the beginning, spaces where they can really tune into the sound they are making, albeit it is the creation of music we are talking about here, for gods sake, but this could have also acted as their Achilles heel. We see this a lot in the music industry, across numerous genres. You could study this pattern like a science. Being under the oppression of entity influence could have potentially caused them to self sabotage and limit themselves from the generosity of the universe - right when the time was right. My own father was in a band during the 90's called "The Cranks." They had received the attention of a major name in the business, the manager of a fairly successful band "Heart." Being scouted, they were about to open up for "Blue Oyster Cult" and then go on a 6 month tour with the band "Trixster." Right when they were about to get this whole thing started, their lead singer, who was using a lot of cocaine(and had an irreplaceable voice), stole all of his girlfriends money and jewelry, never to be seen or heard from by anyone again(actually, a Facebook comment left last year by a man searching for images of the band revealed that he is now a Pastor).

![Pasted image 20250816032734.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250816032734.png)

Much of the Shed's catalog is about their usage of drugs, and they have been able to attract (if you check live concerts) many (impressionable) young teenage kids to their shows. I must say, they do balance things out from time to time by accurately portraying the downsides of this fast lifestyle as-well. The MV for Lighthearted is a great example. You can tell they have already had a developed awareness about how they impact their fans as I dug into older interviews, and in a recent one of Joeyy's, in regards to the question "what advice would you have to your younger self," his response was "never try drugs....................(but understanding that a person's journey is complex, and sometimes the most challenging paths are the ones that lead to the greatest wisdom)......maybe."

It makes you wonder, how many pills were popped, or 4's of lean were poured in the name of becoming a true Shed fan? You can't blame these guys for being bad people at all, because they're not, they are just living life through their will, which was probably inspired by the industry which they themselves were consuming and learned to ascend. They are in no way the inventors of getting high. Drugs, sex, and rock and roll has been the mainstay of our entertainment for decades. The addictions they developed, perhaps falling into entity attachments, may have allowed them to become a sort of channel for these lower energy fields. The youth is already troubled, I get it, if it wasn't this concert they would be at another, of course - but could these guys have unknowingly profited off of the embellishment of this addiction aesthetic? Imagine you are just being yourself, and through this, begin gaining power and influence. Others may pick up on this, looking up to you and replicating your ways of being. What if your way of being may include a little bit of ... entity attachment? It's as though you, perhaps innocently and completely unknowingly, become a guiding compass to these same forces for those who may want to emulate you, these energies almost using their success stories kinda like advertising boards, testimonials. 

![lostboys.gif| 500](/img/user/images/lostboys.gif)

Is that what selling your soul for success is, losing a slight part of it(recoverable) to something in exchange for a sort of advanced talent/gift? I know a few individuals who signed a terrible contract, they had no idea you could have gotten something other than pure chaos. The compilation album for Black Sabbath released in 1976 was quite literally titled "_We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll_." The 27 club, and the more modern 22 club, are both prime examples of this sort of thing having already occurred in our history. It's nothing new or unusual. Socrates discussed something along these lines with his concept of the "daemon." Edgar Allen Poe and Ernest Hemingway, both alcoholics who pushed it pretty hard, lived quite troublesome and short lives. I went to a little exhibit about Vincent Van Gough last year with my gardening team, and wow. That guy was living the emotions of a horror movie, a behind the (beautiful) scenes nightmare. Perhaps this is just the dangerous process of creating great art which expresses the collective at its present moment. One literally becomes the collective unconscious, demonstrating truths and emotions which are under everyone's tongue, bringing them to the light so that they can be recognized, but at one point - must transition back to consciousness before seeing collapse. Some of the greatest friendships I have had in my life were with people that were once addicts, even homeless for periods. Not only do the stories they have to tell align entirely with this entity paradigm, but I can assure you, they don't speak very highly of the lifestyle at all - and wouldn't wish it upon anyone. Someone who has reached the top through similar means, I'm sure, would say something similar. Just because one may have copious amounts of our societally trained metrics for happiness - money and status - doesn't necessarily mean that its there. We are collectively sold an empty dream to chase. "Whoever said money can't solve your problems Must not have had enough money to solve 'em." These are lyrics to Ariana Grande's song 7 rings, which released just 1 year after her boyfriend, Mac Miller, whom I am sure was very well financially adjusted, died at 26 from an overdose of cocaine mixed with fentanyl.

Perhaps God has a greater plan for the Shed and has placed a hold on their success for a brief moment, waitlisting them until auric holes are patched while metamorphizing in their creative cocoon. I am probably doing an injustice to the idea at this current time and may not be ready to speak on these matters quite yet, myself having to go through this same process. To quote Mathew 7:3, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?" We're actually breaking the rules a bit by talking about this stuff, especially when it comes to analyzing other people you've never even met over the internet. I hope, if they were to somehow stumble upon this, they would take my novice attempts at exploring this topic here with a bunch of grace. I believe there is another bible quote about this.... I may butcher it this here, working off of memory, which is vulnerable to confabulation...

# Matthew 15:14
 Let them alone: they be fried leaders of the fried. And if the fried lead the fried, both shall fall into the ditch.


Unknowingly, it's likely the case that a lot of us have our own different auric holes, and once we figure out how to patch them up, leaking our energy, we can find success and balance in the many different domains of life. The friendship that they share with one another is truly special, a unique light which seems to act like a sort of creativity engine, contagious in their memes, performances, and releases. It is nice to see now that many of the members have begun to take the steps to get sober and change the path that they were on. Sobriety for the most part, basically clears these things from people. Think about how hard that process can be, and why many fail and fail for years. Perhaps we view things from the wrong lens when it is through a purely chemical perspective. You are literally fighting for control, cleansing yourself from these different emotional and thought parasites within you, claiming your vessel back, your right to the state of being connected to God itself. It's karma as-well, an accumulation from all we have lived that is playing itself out - including stuff from past lives, hypothetically, making it all the more complex and unpredictable. If we entertain the idea that it may be the end of the world, maybe we should consider the fact that all the names of history could be walking around, heavy karmic loads, both good and bad, unknowingly exist as the lore behind the people you pass by on the street. My brother, whom I believe to be the reincarnation of, and I can't believe I am typing this, Augustus, has been on opiates for as long as I can remember. He couldn't rule Rome this time around, but the way he talks about the time of Oxy 80's, you wouldn't think that pleasure was really any different of a sensation than sitting upon the throne. The Adderall which began this entire story came from a doctors appointment for his medication-assisted opiate treatment, a sample from long ago pushed onto him all because he said he was tired. You can see how some modern doctors, their greed(beneficial moral hole), is just chomping at the bit to get (already known addicts) people high, a vessel for these lower forces to spread. Next thing you know I'll be talking something crazy, like our bodies may be genetically modified Anunnaki slave technology, and the entire opiate drug invention may have been an something pre-destined from this nefarious force brought in from the nonphysical realm beyond time, which understood our biology at such an advanced level and knew how to create something so troublesome, and the social conditions in the world to make its usage rampant. That's a little David Icke level though. Skipping straight to entities is a recipe for disaster, potentially creating something out of nothing, and should only be a last effort attempt to explain situations that just don't seem to find solutions otherwise. It would be foolish to discount the biological and psychological frames which exist underneath these things. Addictions nearly always stem from some sort of trauma, and from my own going abouts in life, almost everybody that I got to know who had an addiction, has a story to tell with it. Grief, especially, plays a tremendous role in this. From research on brain systems in [[The Inner Garden/Brain Systems/Archaeology of Mind\|Archaeology of Mind]], small doses of select opiates were actually found to be perhaps one of the most effective treatments for handling a brain which is overwhelmed with grief circuitry, greatly responsible for many kinds of depression. 

"When people are under the influence of opiates, they say that they feel soothed and comforted. This is because their PANIC/GRIEF system is less active, and it helps explain why lonely, disenfranchised people are more likely to get hooked on such drugs. Indeed, opiates would be almost perfect antidepressants if they were not so addictive."

Could the opiate epidemic really just be product of a world that is depressed, all naturally seeking, and then latching onto something which seems to ease the pain? The grief system gets activated mostly from our social system, could it also be activating from the loss of our previous ways of life, becoming more and more isolated and absorbed in technology? Are the advancements in virtual reality and AI, also something which may have a little bit of healthy conspiratorial entity consideration to be had?

"The fact that endogenous opioids, so similar to opiate drugs of addiction, mediate social relationships indicates that mammals, especially the very young who are completely dependent on others, are literally addicted to social relationships. By their very nature, mammals and other vertebrates, such as birds, maintain family life through opioid-mediated social dependencies, which can become addictions when people satisfy these systems pharmacologically. Thus, one reason why some people are more likely to become addicted to opiate drugs may be that they are not getting enough positive satisfaction out of their social lives. Many may be self medicating because they have chronic feelings of “psychic pain” that arise, in part, from chronically active GRIEF systems. They have learned that they can get relief more rapidly through the immediate consumption of molecules rather than through the development of positive social relationships (Insel, 2003; Panksepp, 1981a)."

Could this be the cure to addiction? Connection? Friendship? 12 step groups seem to be based on this somewhat. Is that the light of God inside each one of us, helping to melt this stuff away directly, what we miss out on when we are not engaging? In physics, an isolated system tends toward greater disorder over time due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy (a measure of disorder) of such a system always increases or remains constant. Community may exist for a reason. Could the Theory of the Shed be able to become walking opiates themselves, in a sense, machines of chemical comradery which activate secretions of sacred and soothing social security directly? 

There's different levels to this whole view. The entities latched on from murder, for example, are going to be a little bit more difficult to get rid of. What do you get? This feeling of immense power and control - people getting 'high' off of their kills. Sickly, what do you think explains the world of pedophilia, ritual-abuse, and sacrifices throughout our history? It is all a form of energy harvesting. Epstein's island had a literal temple, you know... 

![Pasted image 20250819213534.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250819213534.png)

There is no lasting stable joy in the fast 'rockstar' lifestyle, no matter how glorious our culture(influenced by entities) may make it out to seem(the virus spreading itself). It definitely may have its highs, but the lows behind the scenes that come with it all can be quite brutal, and its likely at one point, may even lead one to say that those highs are no longer worth the painful dips. On one hand their journey has been one of individuation, making them unique, perhaps even embarking on a necessary descent into the Qlippoth. In ancient Israel there used to be roaming bands which used music and dancing as a way to induce one into a state of ecstasis and prophecy. Who is to say that in the age of Kali, fully embracing the times, this could not be some form of necessary art which helps us see our own shadow, and entirely been their souls path thus far? Now they can become an example for all their fans showing growth is possible, literally overcoming the forces of the pandoras box which may have been opened, and truly become a powerful force for good(if they so choose).

Marlon's craft has recently been evolving, and I have enjoyed some of what he has put out lately.  For example, in "FEET ON THE GROUND," I very much resonated with the symbolic imagery. It was entirely in line with what I was putting together over at [[Prequel𓂀/Shani\|Shani]], and in moments throughout the video, we become witness to a literal scarlet thread. 

On 7-6-25 Marlon released another video titled "Spirit," in which, he throws up the initials of SHed THeory 

"ST We gon have our day"
 
 I sure hope so.

I would also like to point out that Shed Theory has quite a few songs produced by someone named iokera who died of cancer in 2023. My old friends Erebasu and nic both began to rub shoulders with iokera before he passed, and I believe even became friends with him.

I was actually in one of those Discord groups with him at one point as-well. I was kicked out of that group during a night where I was wilding out on MDMA, talking about how there could be portals to lower astral entities / demons in the music if it was too negative, and we had to be careful. I had just spent the month going through a book called Clearing Entities by Frederick Dodson, and was beginning to see this new layer of reality. Music is a form of channeling energy, and one of the ways entities could enter someone would be through the use of hard drugs. The book specifically mentions that if someone's entire life is centered around music, it is likely they have entity attachments. If people were regularly using pills/whatnot, and then making music(like a lot of people in the group), they could be creating portals to lower astral entities which then others are engaging with and developing energy cords to through listening. The music that can come out of these individuals can be incredibly well made, but at a price. These parasitic ties are existent on a non-physical layer of reality and are one of the main causes of addiction, depression, anxiety, etc. I was fearful that perhaps one my friends may go down this route unknowingly, I could see the truth in it and had to warn them! Now I can come right into the discord chat and (lecture) help educate everyone in there to start changing the world! That's definitely going to work. Once exiled, and understandably, I then went out into the backyard and was met by a floating white light which appeared behind the clouds. Just a few months earlier I had done LSD and this same white orb/light was in my basement. I had never seen anything like that in my life, even on much higher doses. My dog was barking at it and both of us were terrified for weeks afterwards. Witnessing it outside a few months later felt a bit safer and less intrusive, but still, in Fredericks book he talks about these thing showing up in high level 'luciferic' illuminati rituals - so I was completely terrified. I captured a picture of it and slowly got scared. Before I could even think the thought "go away," something Frederick Dodson claims you can say to wield your power over these things, it could detect the shift, that I was tapping out, and immediately disappeared. Was that an entity masterclass for a new amateur teacher of the subject, or could that have been the light of Sophia? Was that my Holy Guardian Angel, a being Aleister Crowley was doing extensive rituals to contact? more on this in [[Prequel𓂀/0. Sequence of Events\|0. Sequence of Events]]

( there were many musicians in the ancient Israelite days that were considered prophets because their music communicated God's word and message )

![Pasted image 20250819145252.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250819145252.png)

One night (on 12-12-24), I was considering writing about iokera's story in [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/Roots of Illness\|Roots of Illness]], but wasn't sure if it was something that should be kept on the backburner for a bit. I was not fully certain if we were drifting into the territory of overreaching theories and potentially being insensitive, or if it was fine and made sense. The whole situation seemed to fit with my ideas well. His music is really quite impressive. A lot of it is also quite heavy. I was going to connect the topic of energy we feed ourselves through music and the emotions that generates, and how that may potentially relate to the generation of illness and our abilities for recovery. I wasn't trying to victim blame anyone who may have developed an illness, or failed to heal from one, painting some false picture of healing, but my research led me to believe that this was something to consider. This whole story seemed like a wonderful demonstration to at-least consider some of the potentiality of this truth, to open up a discussion on the idea. Eventually I decided to think this out a bit more to my favorite piece of his. I had listened to this one countless times in the past. When I first discovered it, I was playing it repeatedly, even shedding a few tears at one point as some part of me resonated so deeply with the soundscape. In this song, iokera profoundly captures the essence of emotional discord and intense grief. On this night, late into dusk, I was a bit taken back to see my intuitive desire for its listening to be met by numerically 'spooky' repetition. This specific trio didn't hold much symbolic importance to me then, but it seems to plug quite nicely into this larger picture. 

Nate Gardiner.

In the garage getting cardboard to put on the window and help tighten up AC unit air flow in my room, I catch myself staring at this stack of tires in the corner which has been in there for years. Covered in plastic wrap, the label said diehard. I remember being 18-19 wearing all black outfits while staring at this and chain-smoking cigarettes, feeling quite gothic. Going inside shortly afterwards, I saw that there was a new video from one of these Shed Theory members, Ricky Chix. It was called die hard. How peculiar for me to reminisce on that and then immediately go inside and boom - there it is, 2 hours ago. Not only that, but the thumbnail looks exactly like the sort of aesthetical imagery that I enjoyed in younger years. Days later I find myself lapsing on my attempts to quit nicotine, stepping back into the past...

I also came across this one on August 24th, roaming through Soundcloud after listening to the new 6 AM album released by Henry Motso...

June 26th 

Both of these songs had repeating numbers at the same time on this date. If you add it up, it equals 11,110. This Caretaker song is from the album -"Everywhere at the end of time," a favorite of mine I used to listen to a lot 6 years ago.

Remember how I mentioned going through a Sade phase, noticing when she began to sing to me in that Panera Bread? This jungle remix used to fuel my way home from work years and years ago, and popped back up on shuffle one of my days gardening. I specifically remember listening to it on the way back from a haircut one time (something I haven't touched in years), feeling like I was about to get somebody pregnant. Researching Aleister Crowley, thinking I may be the guy, I had come across a comment somewhere that mentioned him as perhaps one of the greatest edgelords of all time, alongside someone named Marquis De Sade. Those were the two champs. Somebody underneath explained that it actually made perfect sense to label de Sade an edgelord, because his name itself quite literally implies it. _Marquis_ is a noble title derived from rulers of border territories—literally lords of the edges or margins—and _de Sade_ simply refers to the family he came from. Because of this, I had to look the man up, and it turns out that he was born June 1740, and lived exactly 74 years. All of a sudden the tables started turning and I begin thinking that we've uncovered some of the dark shadowy side of 47, the reverse 74. A natural resurgence of Sade in my playlists, 3333, the signs were all there... I thought I was a decently civil person, but first this Aleister thing, and now this.... could I be the guy they named Sadism after? This 'surprise you're the antichrist' thing is starting to gain some fuel, darn it.... Look if this is the case, you guys caught me red handed, I'll put an end to my shenanigans and switch teams. Thankfully, upon further research, I believe I was led to an alternative life that makes more sense. This overlapped with Marquis De Sade by about 3 years - disqualifying him. Ahhh now I can sleep again at night. [[Prequel𓂀/Gilgun (גלגול)\|Gilgun (גלגול)]]

Edward Kelley in one of his visions stated
"Now I see a great field standing thick with ripe corn, and the ears hang down."

The Angel Nalvage responded explaining its symbolism
"The field is the world. The Corn are such as are ripe for the harvest of God."

Notice they are using the language "harvest" in reference to the Apocalypse - I became very familiar with this term from [[The Inner Garden/Greenhouse/The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]] - a book which forced itself into my face around 2022 surrounding some extraterrestrial events that began to occur in my life, right around the time when I very first began to be interested in the number [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]. Thankfully that version doesn't have to do with any uncomfortable doom situation.

> «I have chosen you, to enter into my barns: And have commanded you to open the Corn, that the scattered may appear, and that which remaineth in the sheaf may stand. And have entered into the first, and so into the seventh. And have delivered unto you the Testimony of my spirit to come..»
> 
> «For, my Barn hath been long without Threshers. And I have kept my flayles for a long time hid in unknown places: Which flayle is the Doctrine that I deliver unto you: Which is the Instrument of thrashing, wherewith you shall beat the shears, that the Corn which is scattered, and the rest may be all one..»
> 
> «(But a word in the mean season.)
> 
> «If I be Master of the Barn, owner of the Corn, and deliverer of my flayle: If all be mine (And unto you, there is nothing: for you are hirelings, whose reward is in heaven.).»
> 
> «Then see, that you neither thresh, nor unbinde, until I bid you, let it be sufficient unto you: that you know my house, that you know the labour I will put you to: That I favour you so much as to entertain you the labourers within my Barn: For within it thresheth none without my consent.»

On Instagram late at night  (7-14-25), I had found way to my old friend Erebasu's profile. A mysterious figure enshrouded with mystery, he has no posts, but only a SoundCloud link in his bio. I clicked it and scrolled on his profile for a second before I saw a repost of the track I had listened to that night on Adderall. For the first time since the evening in which I listened on May 4th, I had somehow navigated to this mix once again, and there it was, perfect timing, 444 likes.  

![IMG_6441.png| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_6441.png)

A few days later (7-18-25), as I was getting myself to flesh out all the new things I've been experiencing, updating this and uploading a new screenshot from my phone to explain the little synchronicity, I had the desire to listen to the track again... and whad'ya know...

Just a month after I’ve finished writing this, learning all these things about Aleister Crowley, considering myself to be his potential reincarnation - Ozzy Osbourne dies on 7-22. One of his most famous songs was titled “Mr. Crowley”, the second of two singles from his debut solo album Blizzard of Ozz, after "Crazy Train". Released in 1980, it was written about Aleister Crowley after Ozzy had read his book "The Diary of a Drug Fiend." Even more interesting is that, just 3 weeks before his death ( June 30th 2025 ), I secretly recorded my father shredding to Ozzie’s biggest hit - Crazy Train - without his awareness. He was forced to re-learn the song for a band reunion he had coming up. One of the owners of the yoga studio which I had gone through my Kundalini training at, the romantic partner of my instructor, actually went to High school with my Pops and graduated the same year. They were in the same circles, my Dad a rock and roll guy(a year older than Myles Kennedy who would hear whispers of a rival guitarist in the hallways), and the yogi in focus, a punk rocker(ever heard of the Vampire Lezbos?) At the yearly employee party, we ended up bantering for a prolonged period about the Testicle Festivals which took place in nearby states - jokingly brainstorming how we may throw one together ourselves. The night became a sort of entrepreneurial think tank - so to speak. In continuing the swordplay, the next day I had texted this video of my father to him - claiming that he wanted to play the song at the epididymitis awareness stand we could set up. Instead of Crazy Train, it could go something along the lines of "My balls are going off of the rails with a crazy paiiiin." 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47TLrZrHF2o?si=p9_i_uBdavpqIYUx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When I told my Dad about the text I had sent, he told me the story of when he actually had epididymitis. I was just a young boy and our family was eating at Applebee's when a tortuous ache had overtaken him. Eventually it got so bad that he had to go to the doctor. When asked about what his symptoms felt like, he looked the doctor directly in the eye and said, "If I were to take my testicles out and lay them down flat right here and then you were hit them with a ballpeen hammer that'd about put you in the ballpark." The doctor replied "Oh okay," marking something on a clipboard before he left the room, a bit put off by a man going off of the rails with a crazy pain. 

I'll be honest, it's probably my fault that he even had to experience this in the first place. I probably caused some sort of lasting trauma after I, as a child, decked my father in the scrotum with all the might a young 3-4 year old could muster. Having just had knee surgery, the man could barely walk. He was coming down the stairs and, at the third or fourth step, received a blow to balls that would instantly fold him down the rest of the way. He was in so much pain that he couldn't even speak or move for about 5 minutes as he sat there on the ground in agony.

  "Aaaaaallllllll aboard, hahahahahaha
  Ayyy (ᴀʏʏ) ₍ₐᵧᵧ₎"

Aleister got his name "The Great Beast" from his evangelically Christian mother during his childhood. He was a very difficult and disorderly child, and embraced the title when it was given to him - going on to live it out further. I myself was a bit of a troublesome character with my own mother while growing up. She never tried to label me as the devil or anything, but at one point, I carved my name into our dining room table, and later the word "bad" next to it. She was going to make me sand the table and repaint it, but decided to keep it and show it off to guests. 

![bad.png](/img/user/images/bad.png)

Ozzy was famously a part of a band called “Black Sabbath” before they kicked him out for being too wild. They came to a consensus that his escalating unreliable behavior and substance abuse was seriously impacting the band's ability to function and record effectively. This is what kickstarted his hugely successful solo career and the release of Blizzard of Oz - with his famous song Mr. Crowley. If we connect things to the larger picture of [[Gilgun\|Gilgun]], could Aleister Crowley almost be seen as a darker Sabbatai Zevi, a Black Sabbath? 

"Mr. Crowley  
Won't you ride my white horse?  
Mr. Crowley  
It's symbolic, of course

Approaching a time that is classic  
I hear that maiden's call  
Approaching a time that is drastic  
Standing with their backs to the wall"

7-31-25

Here I am having finished adding all this Ozzy stuff, and I decide to go listen to his Album Blizzard of Oz of YouTube. I had no idea that this was all apocalyptic themed. He's even dressed in scarlet on the cover, perhaps another nod to Crowley (or just in reference to the scarlet described in the book of Revelation), looking like a crazed wizard. I'm loving it. The first few songs "I Don't Know" and "Goodbye to Romance" were amazing, both with epic guitar solos. Next thing you know it starts playing a song that I didn't know about, titled "Dee". Was this a nod to John Dee?

![Pasted image 20250801010331.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250801010331.png)

The YouTube video, in frame, said that Dee was 49 seconds long. If that were to be true, it could definitely be seen as a reference to the 49 Calls or Keys of Enochian magic. However, if you look on the sidebar of the YouTube playlist, it states that the song is actually 50 seconds long. Now I'm unsure of what to think. I decide to look it up and check another source. I come to Spotify, and it looks like over here, it claims the track to be 49 seconds long. Aha! It is! Wait a second.... it has how many plays??? .... oh lord have sweet mercy on me 

![Pasted image 20250731233746.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250731233746.png)

songfacts.com backs this up (if that's even reliable) by stating 
- "Dee" is a 49-second instrumental acoustic track written and performed by Ozzy's guitarist, Randy Rhoads, who wrote it for his mother, Deloris.

I joined a song circle over the last year or so, a group that gets together weekly to sing and chant. Each week someone volunteers to host, and it travels from location to location. There is a very healing and loving energy which is generated as the tightly-knit community gets together and intimately connects on Friday night. It has been wonderful getting to know all these unique individuals, and the occasion quickly became something I looked forward to attending. Everyone is free to bring a song to share, a poem that has touched them, or anything that is heavy on their heart for support. We also just have a lot of fun. This winter, heading home late at night(after cleaning a yoga studio), I crashed my vehicle into a giant tree that suddenly generated itself in the middle of an inner-city side road. It had unexpectedly fallen from someone's property due to a powerful windstorm I was unaware of. Because of this reason, I had not attended the circle for many months. I finally gained access to the usage of a vehicle again, and started back up. Shortly afterwards, one of the members, someone I had only met a few times, had taken his own life. His body was found in his garden on June 16th. Everyone was in shock. The last time I saw him was the last time I joined the group that winter before my little accident. That night I had the opportunity (thanks to the generosity of the group) to (try my best to) share the [[Prequel𓂀/Kadoish Kadoish Kadoish\|Kadoish Kadoish Kadoish]] mantra. The reason this is significant, is because on this day, the last day I personally would see this man alive, I shared what I believed to be the most secret holy mantra of all time - something I was guided to by aliens. As-well, and unbeknownst to me at the time, I would go on potentially discover that I was the incarnation of the planet Saturn(whatever that may actually mean), and perhaps Sabaoth itself, whom the mantra is towards. This was something brought to the forefront of my synchronistic experience quite heavily around the time of his death.

I was admittedly quite anxious and it wasn't the smoothest delivery, but everyone was very supportive as I sat there talking about The Keys of Enoch, something quiiiiiiitee out there. Jonathan, the man whom we had lost, was always a very cheery and bright person whenever I saw him. He could see I was nervous and extended support over. That was the last time I saw him. I only had the gusto to try and share something myself because I had remembered him sharing a song that he wrote in the months prior(my first ever time joining the circle) - and I thought - that's pretty cool, I've got to step it up to this guys level. There is so much vulnerability to embrace and weird things to overcome in oneself to do something like that, it takes confidence. Jonathan's cheery and enthusiastic attitude to share his songs had transferred to me. He wasn't a lifelong spiritual seeker, but a man that was somewhat new and still learning. He owned this and was actively asking questions, consistently demonstrating a humility and openness to learn, and was contagiously grateful to be on "the path." I had missed the few weeks during which all of the emotions of this loss began to unpack within the group. During this time I began to have synchronicities which were leading me to believe myself to be Shani, the representation of Saturn in Hinduism, who is represented by the crow. I showed back up again on July 12th. Around half-way through our night, in a moment of silence as we all sat there relishing in the joyous stillness of our hearts, a giant flock of crows began to fly over head. First some of them perched on the tree above us, and then a swarm of at-least 20-30 of them flew above. The next morning, on Saturday July 13th, I had gone to listen to some of Jonathan's recordings that were shared in the group chat. 47 views, uploaded Jun 23. 4723. At 1:44 PM as-well. RIP🙏
	Later that day I ended up making a profound realization while analyzing my crow experiences. Although it would be fitting given the Crowley theme to add them here, this is getting a bit long, and will be described in [[Saturn\|Saturn]].

This story is not some synchronistic piece of magic that I was excited to add to this writing and enrich my own project here. I understand that some of the things I may talk about here are perhaps controversial, teetering the edge, and I don't want to necessarily associate him with any of my own stuff. If you are reading this right now, maybe consider taking a moment to send some thoughts and prayers over towards those who have been affected by his death. He was a part of a local band called Prizmatica, and you can listen to some of his wonderful music [here](https://soundcloud.com/jed-wagner/sets/jonathan-songs-2023).

Tuesday July 15th, two days later, right after another crow experience...  

![IMG_6450.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_6450.jpg)

Now that we're at the end of 𓋹 The End 𓆙, let us consider the idea that this entire thing had nothing to with an asteroid plummeting into our atmosphere. Perhaps things began that way, but a new shocking truth may have unfolded as we went along our journey here together. Would it make sense to hypothesize that this was all organized to lead me to a personal "Revelation" that I may be the reincarnation of Aleister Crowley, the incarnation of the planet Saturn, and potentially the messiah? Would this not be the beginning of an "Apocalypse" for the paradigm of reality which holds itself as the mainstay in our society? Yesterday I was just a boy who ate his own boogers...

 The name Sabbatai (שַׁבְּתַי, Shabbetai) is the Hebrew name for the planet [[Prequel𓂀/Saturn and the Secret Council\|Saturn and the Secret Council]]. In Hinduism, the planet Saturn is personified as the deity Shani. The vahana, or vehicle, upon which Shani rides - is the crow. The name "Crow-ley," of course contains "Crow." In a symbolic or magical worldview, such phonetic resemblances are not mere coincidences, but are often seen as clues or "signatures" of a hidden connection. Aleister Crowley himself was a master of such symbolic wordplay, and perhaps myself, Shan(i)e Thorn-ton - born year 2,000, may have some of these skills in my back pocket. The Lurianic Kabbalah, from which Sabbateanism emerged, taught that during creation, divine vessels shattered, and sparks of holiness (nitzotzot) fell into the realm of the "husks" or "shells" of impurity, the Qlippoth (qlipot). The purpose of religious observance (mitzvot) was to slowly raise these sparks. Sabbatai Zevi's radical new theology was that the final, most deeply trapped sparks, could only be redeemed by the Messiah himself descending into the Qlippoth and "rescuing" them. This required the Messiah to commit "holy sins" and engage with impurity directly. His conversion to Islam was interpreted by followers as the ultimate act of this descent—hiding himself in the heart of the "other" to redeem the final sparks. If Sabbatai Zevi's lifetime was the initiation of this descent, then the lifetime of Aleister Crowley could be framed as its fulfillment. Crowley's life was a systematic and public exploration of everything considered forbidden, dark, and Qlippothic by mainstream society and religion. Crowley's "Great Work" was the attainment of spiritual enlightenment and union with the divine, but his method involved confronting and integrating all aspects of the self, especially the shadow. His central tenet, "Do what thou wilt," takes on a new meaning. While often misinterpreted as simple hedonism, in this context, the Law of Thelema can be seen as the ultimate mandate to follow one's True Will, even if it leads into realms of darkness and transgression, in order to gather all of one's scattered parts (the sparks). A key part of Crowley's system is the ordeal of "Crossing the Abyss," where the magician must face the ultimate dissolution of the ego in the confrontation with the demon Choronzon(talked about in [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]). This is a perfect parallel to the Sabbatean Messiah's descent into the Qlippoth. All of this, as-well, perfectly aligns with the theology of Sabaoth's journey from Archon to redeemed Archon in the Gnostic myths. From this perspective, Crowley wasn't simply a "dark magician"; he was playing the necessary role of the redeemer who must become intimately familiar with the prison he intends to demolish. He took Sabbatai's theological concept and lived it as a complete magical and psychological reality. Enantiodromia is a principle that was introduced to the west by Carl Jung, an idea that whenever there is a superabundance of any force, it inevitably produces its opposite. By pushing the "descent into darkness" to its absolute limit in the Crowley incarnation, the soul's trajectory creates the maximum possible potential energy for an equally powerful ascent. The descent into the Qlippoth, this trek into the forbidden, the impure, the shadow—can be seen not just as chaos for its own sake, but the necessary counterbalance in a larger rhythmic arc, setting the stage so that the return swing of the cosmic pendulum may slingshot the soul back toward the divine heights with equal force. 
 
 The Messiah who theoretically emerge from this would not be a naive, innocent savior. Instead, they would be a perfect example of Jung's archetype "The Wounded Healer." Having fully mapped and experienced the realm of the Qlippoth from within, they would be uniquely qualified to heal and cleanse it. This soul would know every shadow, every demon, every trap, because they have brushed shoulders with those corners of consciousness themselves. Their compassion would not be abstract and idealistic; it would be born of shared direct experience with the fallen, an intimate knowing. In this redemptory lifetime, the soul would not be overcoming the "darkness of Aleister Crowley," but rather integrating it. The immense knowledge, power, and freedom gained during that incarnation would be transmuted from a Qlippothic force into a force for universal redemption. The darkness becomes the fuel for an even greater light. By having descended to the very bottom, the final ascent would be so powerful that it would pull up all the remaining sparks, cleansing the realm of the Qlippoth once and for all, completing the cosmic _Tikkun Olam_ (repair of the world).

I drifted away from the asteroid thing, but ended up coming across an old artist I listened to in the past that made me think again. I was a bit shocked looking back. Not only was I consuming such darkly terrifying music(although I do want to pay my upmost respects to Sito and his art), but the entirety of the video is in black and white - except for the color Shani. Of course in this scenario, it is gang related, but it resonates profoundly with the symbolism in [[Prequel𓂀/Shani\|Shani]]. I used to listen to his songs nonstop, especially the album Maybe this is just an energy release, to see stuff I used to resonate with and recognize the thread has turned white(at-least somewhat), but also, the song title is 13 - the date of April in 2029 when Apophis is supposed to pass us by. 

![IMG_6814.png| 300](/img/user/images/IMG_6814.png)

Worst case scenario, if this thing did fly directly into the planet, the good news is, it wouldn't be powerful enough to take us all out. It would be strong, around 10,000 megatons of TNT strong, over 100,000+ Hiroshima bombs strong, enough to take out a small city like London strong, but it wouldn't separate the sphere in two. If it were to land in water, sure, we may see some 800 ft tsunamis or something, and yeah, maybe they destroy the coastlines of multiple countries, but, we will survive. 

Anyway, I'm going to let this one rest for a bit. Give it some time to simmer on the backburner. 
Let's say we take this back up on the night of Thursday April 12th 2029, shall we?
Should give us plenty of time to start thinking of a plan.

Cheers 🥂

It would only be right to finish things out with the quote 
which closed the 1994 TV movie "Without Warning."

The film aired on CBS the night before Halloween, depicting a sudden asteroid crisis through the realistic lens of news broadcasts. It was designed to mimic live reports, capturing the world's escalating panic as catastrophe began to unfold (and indeed it caused some panic amongst those who didn't know they were watching a movie). In Fort Smith Arkansas, their local CBS station received dozens of calls from people concerned the events were actually occurring. The area's ABC, Fox, and NBC stations were also receiving calls from people complaining and wondering why they weren't covering the same events as CBS(despite every commercial break making it clear that it was fiction). 

As radar picks up on a plethora of asteroids(really its an alien invasion, spoiler) beginning to rain down upon the planet, a knowingness that it is the end begins to sink into the awareness of the News Anchor. 

He leaves the viewers with one final quote from Shakespeare, 
the words of poet to ponder as their annihilation is unfolding... 

"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves"
	_The Tragedy of Julius Caesar_

![giphy.gif](/img/user/images/giphy.gif)

I originally ended things there... but as time progressed, I have to make this addition, which actually is synchronous to the original finale which discussed the movie Without Warning. 

One of the other hypotheses, as to the effects of Enochian magic, is that the watchtowers which are unlocked and unbound are aspects of the collective mind. Many modern magicians interpret spirits, angels, and demons as personifications of archetypal forces within the collective unconscious. In this view, Enochian magic would be a particularly powerful method for accessing and "unbinding" the most fundamental and potent archetypes that have been repressed or "dissociated from" by modern society. These parts of the consciousness of the Earthly sphere have been bound up or banished from awareness - dissociated from - locked away - in a manner akin to the punishments we hear the fallen angels having received(particularly within the original Book of Enoch itself). In a sense, our shared quantum space still holds these energies deep within of our system of self, exiled parts we have dissociated from. To actually come into a place of wholeness, these aspects must be released and integrated, shedding trauma from the planetary nervous system and gaining the diamonds encoded within that process. This aligns wonderfully with the kabbalistic concept of Tikkun Olam and the rectifying of the qlippothic shells.

A persistent debate in occult circles is whether the entities Dee and Kelley contacted were truly angels of God or the "Watchers" from the _Book of Enoch_—the fallen angels who were imprisoned for giving humanity forbidden knowledge. This theory suggests that the Enochian "Keys" are literal keys to their prisons. The magician, by performing the rituals, is unwittingly unleashing these ancient, powerful, and potentially malevolent forces upon the world. The Enochian process unbinds and welcomes these aspects back in, giving them the capacity to influence the minds of humanity - and - potentially prompt the apocalypse through the ignorant and fallible vessel of man. Maybe we can handle these energies and alchemize them into our evolution, if destruction wasn't the end goal, transmutation and whatnot. Perhaps the ascension is a destruction, meant to bring us back to the original heavenly realm beyond this lesser dream? Unbeknownst to those in power, they may not be spiritually cognizant enough to recognize the intelligently subtle ques for violence and destruction which begin to pop up in their intuitions(or perhaps they are meant to follow along). Theoretically, this may hold weight if we consider the fact that things could only begin to commence as a result of the "God Christ" working these operations. Only when the gears of the cosmic clock come to their pre-ordained position, when it strikes the hour mark and the great grandfather bell rings, does this begin to all unfold. For whom the bell tolls, only the one with the capacity to strike it, and given their position, likely at the time in which they are allotted to do so... 

 I didn't really give much merit to this second idea here when I first was exposed to hit, however, it seemed that things did begin to occur on a larger scale in alignment with my private working. On June 6, downtown Los Angeles erupted after a series of ICE raids swept through the city—detaining workers in the Fashion District, a Home Depot in Westlake, and more. The protests began at the detention center gates but quickly spread, spilling into the streets with smashed storefronts, burning barricades, and the terror of tear gas against concrete. The unrest radiated outwardly through the country like a shockwave, surfacing itself by mid-June in the city of my current residency Spokane. On June 11, sparked by ICE’s detainment of two Venezuelan asylum-seekers, hundreds gathered at their office. Former City Council President Ben Stuckart and others blocked a transport van, triggering a standoff. Police deployed smoke canisters, PepperBalls, foam rounds, and bean bags to disperse the crowd. In all there were over 30 arrests primarily for failure to disperse, with some charged under felony statutes for obstructing federal officers. I was actually downtown at the time, having no idea any of this was occurring, and watched as an enormous armored SWAT vehicle drove past me with a man sitting out of the roof and others on its side. Later that night, a citywide curfew was declared, which I, unknowingly broke. Watching the escalation, I couldn’t help but see the mirror to the Enochian vision - parts long bound within the collective psyche tearing free, archetypes rising like the “Watchers” of old, pressing into the human sphere with raw, unmediated force. Whether these forces drive us toward destruction or transfiguration who knows...

But what occurred shortly afterwards was even more profound. For myself, if we simply roll with the possibility of this working unlocking anything - what we saw occur in the collective directly after my working here was quite the release of powerful emotions. It seems that even more violence began to prod its head back up after months of silence, Iran and Israel butting heads once again. In a manner that was visually in direct alignment with the ending of the movie Without Warning, Iran dispersed a tremendous amount of missiles which rained upon the city of Israel.

Even if this asteroid isn't coming towards what may have occurred was the planting of the seeds of WW3. The darker energies may have found route to root their influence - whispering demonic Jenga moves to the big players so that they may pull the crucial pieces holding this thing together and so the tower will fall and collapse - to get this game over with. However, both of these issues have already been active and bubbling under the surface for some time. It would be totally rational and logical that these things would eventually occur, and the timing may be coincidental.

Perhaps we are able to, as a collective, withstand these devious whispers of destruction, and, the Earth will see a renewal through consciousness. We successfully navigate these powerful unbound energies (if that is even the case) and they are able to be transmuted and transformed into what brings us into wholeness, the emerging "Golden Age." Perhaps part of that process is some sort of disaster which wakes us up ... who knows... but it may not be necessary. 

Lets say that all of that was nonsense and this is just a projection of my own personal internal energies, amplified and made to be their most extreme so as to be recognized, healed, released, and let go. Maybe I am Aleister Crowley, Saturn, and whoever else. This leaves the possibility that the Enochian process is entirely subjective to my own world and my own sort of apocalypse/revelation is occurring. This opens us up also to the potential that - I myself and my own consciousness is in fact the apocalypse, not that it's really all that different from your own. -The great 666 revelation - there is no cataclysm on the verge of occurrence - but my awakened presence is such a ball of truth beyond the accepted regular scientific paradigm, that the world is forced to wake up(to their own divinity). This Enochian process transformed me, and through that, I can affect this person or that person, and maybe they can begin to go through their own celestial unpacking, and each individual alters the world as we snowball down from there. Perhaps this waking up is prior to a destruction of everything, and that is why things are occurring at this time, but also, its entirely possible the transformation of humanity can occur peacefully without cataclysm. If the Gnostic tale is true, the destruction of the material world would actually be a good thing. Perhaps I am so deeply lost that I am in-fact a false prophet, as this 666 character was prophesized to be by certain Christians - and you should ignore everything I say. Don't take my advice, it's not the right time - let me integrate this new shadow awareness. Either way, there is no need to fret or hold onto any sort of fear, by the time we are stripped of our fleshly bodies, if that ends up being the case, you should have had ample time figure out where we are headed - back to the ol' Pleroma we go. Get your shit together so you have something to take with you, and maybe someone to hold while the embers envelop your body, shedding you from this mortal prison.

From the end of Aleister Crowley's Bornless Ritual adaptation,

I am He, the Grace of the World:  
  "The Heart Girt with a Serpent" is My Name

Iao Sabao
Such are the Words!





Please don't think I'm taking this form of gematria too seriously, it's mostly just for fun.. or is it..
