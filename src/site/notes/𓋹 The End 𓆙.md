I had gone to the dispensary, 
and, as I was checking out, 
began in conversation with the cashier. 
He asked me what I had been up to that night, and I told him,
"I've been going down a rabbit hole on the number [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]]."
He began to tell me about the number 23, 
how he had gone down a rabbit hole on that before, 
and also about a book that opened his eyes to things years prior,
"Behold, A Pale Horse".

I had never heard of anything about the number 23 before, except for the movie featuring Jim Carrey. At first, paranoia struck in(good product), and for a moment I thought that maybe this man was subtly attempting to diss me -  referencing the film and mocking my obsession with a silly number directly to my face. I did get in there kinda close to closing.... but no, that couldn't be right. I looked it up and saw there was in fact quite some legitimate obsession with the number, what I'm sure inspired the script for the blockbuster. 

This all reminded me of a song which I used to listen too years prior, titled "23".
I had gone to look it up, and the individual with the username 23 on Soundcloud was sitting at exactly 7777 followers. How interesting, 4 7s.


![9730BA45-23AE-48EE-B9CE-4F00C9F7D715.png| 300](/img/user/images/9730BA45-23AE-48EE-B9CE-4F00C9F7D715.png)

After reminiscing to a song which seemed to hold the memories of a barbeque held in the summer of 2018, whoever's Mustang my elderly Grandfather was revving I can't fully recollect, I decided to search for the book which was recommended to me 

![462A7FCF-67AB-4091-BD3D-72BE12B51277.png| 300](/img/user/images/462A7FCF-67AB-4091-BD3D-72BE12B51277.png)

I didn't think too much of it other than the fact that it was a really cool little 
double synchronicity. Somehow the timing aligned perfectly to reflect repeating numbers in both areas. You could check both numerical quantities 2 hours later and would be missing out, the orchestration of such navigation is incalculable. Throughout this period I was working quite heavily on [[Prequel𓂀/47\|47]], and felt this was just some motivation to keep moving forward. I mean, this sort of strangeness was a regular part of nearly every day of mine at this point. Much of the direction things took began to expose a Book of Revelation, end times theme, something I didn't necessarily anticipate, but found interesting as I continued to pull what I could out of the backlog. The title of the book, "Behold a Pale Horse," being a reference to Revelation, seemed to inspire a further embrace of this emerging theme.  

"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
	Revelation 6:7-8 (KJV)

Weeks go by, and one of the things I ended up discovering was that the Greek word for The Angel of Death, Azrael, translated to an Isopsephy value of 144, a number which the Book of Revelation made quite important.

![azrael.jpg](/img/user/images/azrael.jpg)

Having already immersed myself in deep study of Azazel, the scapegoat, I started to look further into the very similarly named Azrael. I discovered that Azrael was essentially who the verse of Revelation was mentioning, in regards to the one who rode the pale horse. The deeper connection budding its head, I decided to look a little further and try some gematria.  

![Pasted image 20250513040205.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250513040205.png)

I also went to listen to that song again, but this time on YouTube. 

![BB2E60A4-441B-4C68-ACAD-92CD5CC6B6B8.png| 300](/img/user/images/BB2E60A4-441B-4C68-ACAD-92CD5CC6B6B8.png)

Fast forward a little bit, a few weeks, and I'm taking Adderall for the first time in my life. 
Nothing too crazy, just 20mg, something they prescribe to kids(which baffles me).
I'm in my brother's grandmother's backyard gardening like a soldier. 
We watched the movie Azrael the night before, and it was pretty good. Spooky.
It is May 4th, our mothers birthday, and I am certainly feeling the force. 

Later that night I found myself, well, not really coming down. The high kept persistent, and I was forced to meditate for a while, eventually just to lay down. I was even sweating a little bit, and from time to time would shake with energy. It was unrelenting. No wonder those kids are so good at Fortnite. I began to breathe deeply, and, thanks to the added focus, I sat there with mindful precision for quite a while. 

At a certain point, I found myself having a sort of inkling. I feel some other force attempting to enter my space. I sit for a moment and try to discern what it is that's occurring, and after some moments, I discover, oh, it's Azrael. Ooooof course. Well, I know that my subconscious is primed to be filled with things centered around this supposed angel, this isn't necessarily that surprising. Perhaps I'm some sort of receiver that has been warmed up over the last few weeks for this meeting, the drug opening a channel of perception/energy in which this is now able to take place. Or, perhaps my brain is flooded with an excess of dopamine, and I am beginning to touch a very light state of, not necessarily psychosis, but lets say, fantastical creative imagery. 

Either direction I'm here for it.

Somewhat humored, and deepening into a letting go, I began to entertain this active imaginative experience. I remember reading through Carl Jung's Red Book, his most profound writing, the entirety being a recollection of these sorts of experiences which he himself had. I allowed it all to unfold. The swirling of that which was running itself through my mental sphere, a culmination and combination of what the months prior contained. It felt as though this being was attempting to relay to me a message, one which was tinged with a dark truth, somewhat rough - the delivery had to be sensitive. I didn't want to shy away, but instead sought honesty, for the band aid to be ripped off. I could feel a tangible bit of hesitancy, a shyness, a reluctance, but also, a deep pleasure in the fact that the transmission of truth was unfolding, that receptivity was present, as I heard in my head - "4 years..... and 7 days." 
	If I were to really slow things down in that moment, you could see the exact point in which part of my psyche began to leave the trance I was in, barely turning back online just to throw the little 7 day part in there, it was hilarious(amidst the admittedly heavy theme). 

![Pasted image 20250520125444.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250520125444.png)

Alright so that's it, I die in 4 years or something? 4 years and 7 days? Just me or are we talking worldwide nuclear warfare? Do I get some sort of disease and die early maybe? Should I not cross the street during this time? No airplanes or amusement parks, got it.

Let's throw this into the calendar, hopefully my schedules free.

In doing some digging, I discovered there was, not exactly 4 years (and 7 days) to the date, but an asteroid that was deemed potentially dangerous, supposed to pass the Earth in arooouuunnnd 

3 years and 11 months. 
Hmmm.

Friday the 13th, 
April 2029, 
Asteroid Apophis 99942 

I spend the last 3 years discovering that I may 
_potentially_ 
be the reincarnation of the final Pharoah of Egypt ... 
a man they called "Little Caesar's",
maybe even the messiah,
and now, 
here I am,
having a prophetic moment,
with the Adderall Angel of Death,
discovering that there's an asteroid the size of the Rose Bowl,
coming suspiciously close to us,
named after the the Egyptian embodiment of destruction and disorder,
viewed as the greatest adversary to Ra, 
whom attempts to consume the sun every night,
holding the title "Enemy of Ra," 
as-well as "the Lord of Chaos."

The thickening of the plot here is absolutely astounding.

![[Apep and Ra.JPG]]

When Apophis was first discovered in 2004, initial observations indicated a small chance, 2.4%, that it would collide with Earth in 2029. This sparked great concern, and Apophis was placed on the highest level of the Torino scale, a method for evaluating impact hazards. Later observations opened this possibility to 2036 or 2068(given it were to have its trajectory continuously altered by Earths gravitational orbit on each passing). Preliminary observations in January 2013 allowed them to predict that this would ultimately not happen, and we would be safe. In March 2021, new radar observations allowed astronomers to precisely recalculate Apophis's orbit. These refined measurements definitively ruled out any risk of the asteroid hitting Earth for at least the next 100 years. As a result, Apophis was removed from international impact hazard lists, alleviating previous concerns about a potential collision, what would have been devastating, the reason why the asteroid was named after the Egyptian god of chaos and destruction. It would have caused a cataclysm unlike anything else our species has ever seen in recorded history. Not on the level of what wiped out the dinosaurs, but still, it would drastically affect the systemic global ecosystem. 

The average diameter of Apophis is estimated to be between 330 and 340 meters (around 1,100 feet). Due to its elongated and possibly peanut-like shape, its longest side stretches to approximately 450 meters (nearly 1,500 feet). To put this into perspective, Apophis is often described as being taller than the Eiffel Tower, or comparable in length to about five NFL football fields.

![apophis-in-new-york-city.jpg.jpeg](/img/user/images/apophis-in-new-york-city.jpg.jpeg)

The average distance between Earth and the Moon is about 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). We have Geostationary satellites that orbit Earth at an altitude of 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers).

When Apophis performs its drive-by, it is supposed to come 19,800 miles (31,860 kilometers) above Earths surface, ten times closer to us than the Moon, closer than some of our satellites. 

These are fighting words. 
Apophis plans on entering our bubble.
It will be the closest largest thing that we will have ever observed,
visible from the ground with your own naked eye(final days nudist colony anyone?).
This asteroid is going to rock our world with a once-in-a-lifetime experience, 
coming within a cosmic whisker of Earth, close enough to let us hear her purr. 

Every time Apophis has passed us thus far, Nasa sonographers were able to pick up audible noises from its passing.

	"I'll be right back" *evil laugh*

If there's one thing this asteroid and I have in common, 
it's that we both keep coming back.

Gareth Collins, a professor in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London, estimates that Apophis, if it were to strike Earth at 45,000 mph (72,000 km/h) —   the average speed of asteroid impact  —  it would release energy analogous to

10,000,000,000,000,000,000  (10 billion billion) Joules

For those of us with no capacity to comprehend such a numbers meaning other than,
big, 
he then goes on to say,

"This is equivalent to the explosive yield of the global nuclear arsenal," and further, 
"About 100,000 times more than the energy of the Chelyabinsk meteor 
and a million times more energy than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima."

Thankfully we're safe though.
Right?

Some recent studies (in 2024) have explored the very low-probability scenario of Apophis being struck by another, smaller asteroid, which could theoretically alter its path. All it would take would be a simple meteoroid, approximately 1 meter in diameter, to hit Apophis at the wrong place, wrong time. This would be enough to knock Apophis from its current trajectory, putting it on a collision course with Earth. This may have even already happened, Apophis being outside of our line of vision currently, and we would have absolutely no idea until 2027 (at the earliest). However, these studies concluded that the chances of such an event deflecting Apophis into a collision course with Earth are exceedingly remote, on the order of one in a million or less.

As I was putting this together, about a week after my experience, admiring Bladee's subtle references to the scarlet thread theme, I saw this...

![Pasted image 20250520140011.png| 400](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250520140011.png)

Who knows..... maybe some aliens have decided that we've got it coming to us, and they decide to pull it in a little closer at the last second? Maybe its a mothership itself, the Annunaki God's which seeded the globe, returning to the planet once again(have you seen Alien vs Predator). 
Genuinely, I know its a bit sci-fi and absurd, but could these things be a possibility if we really consider the conditions of our planet today?  

Good thing is, is that on May 15th, the Trump administration decided to propose a plan which would slash NASA's overall budget by 24%. This would include a steep, wait for it, _47%_ cut to NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD). This department is responsible for planetary defense efforts, including; detecting, tracking, and characterizing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets, managing programs and missions aimed at understanding the risk of impacts(developing mitigation strategies), as-well as overseeing crucial planetary defense missions, like the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor space telescope, which was designed to detect potentially hazardous asteroids. It would be the largest single-year cut to NASA in U.S. history.

Casey Dreier, Chief of Space Policy at The Planetary Society, stated, 
"This would be a devastating budget for NASA science... 
It would force the agency to effectively dismantle its science program."

More from a group letter sent by concerned scientists and stakeholders to Congressional leaders...

"Such a drastic reduction would inflict immediate and irreparable damage upon the nation's space science enterprise... This proposed budget cut is not merely a line item adjustment; it represents a potential dark age for American space science, sacrificing our cosmic inheritance for short-term expediency."

I for one argue that we give Boeing the contract for asteroid deflection.

Have you seen the movie Don't Look Up?

Is it possible that some of what was to come was leaked in this screenplay, released to the public without their awareness of the coming Apophis? A sort of humorous ploy, they let the working class watch the film as though it were simply entertainment, and not a warning for what to come, hiding in plain sight what only those who are on the in know? At the very end of the movie, a certain select group of elites, the ultra-rich, escape on a unique spaceship, making it away from the destroyed Earth and arriving on another planet(22,740 years later). They emerge naked, paralleling the Garden of Eden. Discussing the success rate of the cryochambers, the president gets out and remarks that “We only had 47 dead in our section,” right before... well.. you should just see for yourself...

What about the movie Melancholia?
Released November 11th, 2011
11-11-11
Its a film showing the different ways in which people are coping with the coming planet, Melancholia, which is flying into Earth. Now, it's a god awful movie, incredibly boring, at-least for me, maybe if I had some mushrooms or something I might get a little out of it(now we're onto something), but it is so inline with the times. In-fact 1hour and 11minutes in, one of the main characters begins describing how scientists have said this thing is just going to fly by and it is not going to hit the planet, trying to calm down his wife as though she was becoming senile. The science seems to debunk things, in the same way science has debunked Apophis. The charts and diagrams, all of it is essentially very similar to Apophis.
I'm not saying this is some in your face illuminati film, but I mean, the repeating 1's.... I think God leaves little breadcrumbs through the creative work of different people. As art comes through someone, big man upstairs can drop little pieces of the celestial puzzle inside without them having any awareness.

![melancholia.jpeg](/img/user/images/melancholia.jpeg)

In every single movie that has ever involved this scenario, the government never admits that the world is coming to an end until the last 72 hours or so.... 
What if they do end up seeing that this thing was heading right towards Earth?
Would they tell us?
Right away?
What about all the panic that would erupt?
And oh, those financial markets, they would be thrown asunder...

Thankfully Nasa has the technology to do something about it.
In 2022 their DART mission (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was a success. 
Flying a 200 million dollar spaceship into an asteroid, they successfully redirected it's course, 
proving the efficiency of the use of a kinetic impactor. 
There is a plan to meet to flying rock in space, face to face, kamikazi-ing into the object.  
We theoretically have the capacity to alter its course, and, if we are lucky, divert it directly into Florida.

"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many died from the water, because it was made bitter. 
	Revelation 8:10–11

We should consider the fact that this impact would throw a substantial amount of dirt and debris into the upper atmosphere, debris which would not clear for a considerable amount of time. 

In 1816, the largest eruption in recorded history occurred at Mount Tambora, a volcano located in what is now Indonesia. The eruption caused so much Sulphur to fly into the atmosphere that global temperatures dropped, leading to cold weather and food shortages. The reason for the suns absence was unknown to the world at the time, causing mass panic. They did not know that volcanic ash and debris was thrown up into the stratosphere and had blocked the sun, causing a gradual lowering of temperatures. This time was infamously dubbed as the "The Year Without a Summer." This led to famines all across the Northern hemisphere, one of the darkest periods in human history. 

Coincidentally, sun spots (temporary dark areas from strong magnetic fields) appeared (on the sun) that were large enough to be seen by the human eye. This gave seeking scientists a potential cause for the absence of light which used to rain upon the land. 

"The large spots which may now be seen upon the sun's disk have given rise to ridiculous apprehensions and absurd predictions. These spots are said to be the cause of the remarkable and wet weather we have had this Summer; and the increase of these spots is represented to announce a general removal of heat from the globe, the extinction of nature, and the end of the world."
	from the _London Chronicle_

A scientist in Italy predicted that the Sun would go out on the 18th of July 1816. The prophecy caused riots, suicides, and fervor(especially of the Religious variety) all over Europe. From a newspaper of the age,

"A Bath girl woke her aunt and shouted at her that the world was ending, and the woman promptly plunged into a coma. In Liege, a huge cloud in the shape of a mountain hovered over the town, causing alarm among the "old women" who expected the end of the world on the eighteenth. In Ghent, a regiment of cavalry passing through the town during a thunderstorm blew their trumpets, causing "three-fourths of the inhabitants" to rush forth and throw themselves on their knees in the streets, thinking they had heard the seventh trumpet."

That was the context of the month which Lord Byron wrote his poem, the whole of it could be seen as a reference to Matthew 24:29
"the sun shall be darkened."

![DarknessByron1816.jpg| 500](/img/user/images/DarknessByron1816.jpg)

Now, to understand fully the situation unfolding here we will have to take a brief detour into the 15th century; Particularly to the golden age of England, the Elizabethan era (1558-1603). The story begins with a world class mathematician/secret agent, and his sidekick, an ambiguous alchemist with a suspect past and only the lower 70% of his ears...(No this is not the introduction to an anime). The hunt for buried treasure, angelically powered international espionage, the formula for the end of the world, paranormally ordained wife swapping, and the original celestial language which Adam spoke in the Garden of Eden.

Firstly, let me introduce you to our main protagonist, Dr. John Dee. 

![Pasted image 20250505224120.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250505224120.png)

![Screenshot 2025-05-05 223947.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Screenshot%202025-05-05%20223947.png)

![Screenshot 2025-04-15 044257.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Screenshot%202025-04-15%20044257.png)

One of the most influential figures of Elizabethan England, John Dee was a true polymath. He was a mathematician, teacher, astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and linguist, as well as a skilled navigator and cartographer. Dee was also a pioneering scholar and occult philosopher, collecting and curating one of England’s largest private libraries(with many rare private picks). His intellect and wide-ranging expertise was renowned, and he served as a trusted advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, whose court frequently sought his counsel on matters of science, exploration, and the mystical arts.

John was so good at cryptography that he was the founder of England's first secret intelligence service, preceding what would eventually be the UK's infamous MI6. Under Queen Elizabeth I's rule, he established the worlds most comprehensive network of spies. When he would write to the Royal Highness, he would signify his authorship with only a few numbers, 007. That's right, this is where the smooth and cool James Bond hijacked his famous trademark from. 

![007.jpg](/img/user/images/007.jpg)

Dee was also the man that coined the famous term "British Empire." He had met the queen when she was younger and under house arrest by her half sister (whom would later provide the material for the popular "Bloody Mary" myth). Her science tutor, they developed a friendship that would last. After becoming Queen, she funded and supported many of his endeavors, and later protected John from those claiming he was a sorcerer into witchcraft.

 Already extracting all that he could perceive from the natural world, Dee's curiosity began to branch out. He eventually became concentrated on the idea of theurgy, God becoming directly involved in our affairs through the work of miracles or divine intervention. He sought knowledge which could not be formulated from the material plane, embracing theories that through the study and practice of invoking supernatural deities, i.e. angels, he may be able to acquire secret or lost information, perhaps insight into the mysteries of existence. 

It seemed however, that John would run into blocks. Consistently hitting walls in his personal practice, he failed to manifest anything magnificent. However, things seemed to have taken a turn in the year of 1581. According to his journal, while kneeling in prayer, John was suddenly in the bright glowing presence of archangel Uriel. Here the entity handed over to John a clear crystal, what he would end up calling a shewstone(the OG term for crystal ball). Dr. Dee was told that by gazing through it, he would be able to establish contact with angels. What would eventually become known as scrying, John was given a technique whereby messages could be transmitted from alternate realities by gazing into the appropriate reflective object. 

![medium_a127915__0002_.jpg| 300](/img/user/images/medium_a127915__0002_.jpg)
	The original on display in the British Museum today 

John followed the instructions that Uriel gave him to a T, but alas, found no success. Eventually he gave up and began to look for eyes he could outsource his venture to, some sort of scryer who could actually see. Interviewing many men, none of them seemed to be the vehicle of visionary value Dee was after. They either failed or attempted to blow smoke up his rear end, deceitful and dubious fraudsters caught by his careful attention to detail. 

Eventually, however, John came to meet who would end up being the second most important character in our story, the mysterious enigma of a man - Edward Kelley(born 1555). Originally introducing himself as Edward Talbot(if either of those were even his real name), he wore a cap to hide the fact that both ears had been chipped, a common punishment for forgery during the age. Despite the disguise, he seemed to be a natural. In their first meeting Kelley could see, hear, and communicate with the angels. John Dee, even with a critical eye, saw that this was not Maybelline, he must have been born with it. Convinced that Kelley's skill was genuine, he was chosen for the road ahead. This was the beginning of an intense 7 year period in which the two would undertake scrying sessions on an almost daily basis. 

What famously sits in the museum with all of John Dee's magical tools is an obsidian mirror, thought to be used for scrying in addition to Uriel's present. Modern research completed within just the last 3 years has shown that this mirror originally came from the Aztec region of Mexico. In Aztec culture, obsidian mirrors were powerful ritual objects connected to the god Tezcatlipoca—“The Smoking Mirror”—a deity associated with divination, magic, and the ability to see into other worlds. Many thought Dee was unknowingly drawing on a tradition of mystical vision that stretched back centuries. However, in his journals it seems that this mirror didn't really work, he didn't actually use it hence why it was never made part of his Enochian system. Just a neat detail I noticed in research that, seemingly everyone else misses. Perhaps still it provided inspiration for the title of the show, "Black Mirror"? Some speculate that the mysterious extraterrestrial black object became somewhat of an archetype and was inspiration for the monolith in Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.

![1280px-John_Dee's_Aztec_Scrying_Mirror.jpg](/img/user/images/1280px-John_Dee's_Aztec_Scrying_Mirror.jpg)

If you have ever seen any sort of magical imagery with someone staring into a crystal ball, this is where it originally came from. Eventually the angels would teach John and Edward that this device could be used by contacting the appropriate angel of the appropriate region, to spy on anyone, anywhere. I am the eye in the sky, looking at yoooouuuuuu, I can reead your miindd. They were unknowingly taking part in, and outlining the structure for, the worlds first MK Ultra remote viewing project. It's quite fitting given Dee's association with the development of England's first secret spy organization(and a good thing they didn't have acid). John Dee was the original crazed archetypal wizard alchemist whose story has inspired our culture for centuries after his death.

When they first began, the two received directions to construct solomonic like furniture and ritual objects which they would use as part of a system of astral magic. These included inscribed tables, wax seals, and other tools, all believed to be essential for safely navigating the world of spirits. What is now generally referred to as the heptarchic system, it was a synthesis of the reigning magical themes with those of the past, an improvement on the established medieval system(what some scholars are arguably more impressed by than any of the Enochian stuff). One of these was an improvement on the Sigillum Dei —reimagined as the Sigillum Dei Aemeth—which integrated angelic Enochian script inside intricate geometric layers, surrounded by the names of a new divine hierarchy(DLC update). I must note, it looks awfully similar to Apple's new Ai logo, but...  it is just a heptagram after all.... 

![Original 1.png](/img/user/images/Original%201.png)

All of this preparation served as a grand set up for what would, about a year later, begin to be unveiled. Dee, being a pious Christian, would force Kelley into long periods of prayer, fasting, and other methods of purification prior to having him gaze into a shewstone nearly all day. In his journals, Dee would document everything Kelley would see or hear. With their ritual gear assembled and their shewstones polished, Dee and Kelley found themselves on the threshold of something entirely unexpected: the transmission of a celestial book. But not just any book... the book which Enoch himself was said to have copied down during his trip to heaven, containing the original language of the angels, what was lost forever during the great flood. 

The 1583 Saturn-Jupiter conjunction was critical for understanding Dee's work. It signaled, according to prevailing astrological belief, the end of an era and the imminent start of major, potentially apocalyptic, global transformations. This was due to the shift from a watery to a fiery trigon, a starry pivot which only occurs every 200-240 years. Dee felt that the end of the world was immanent, this being largely inspired by astronomical observations. The coming great conjunction was foreshadowed by the appearance of a supernova in 1572, an extremely bright and lengthy comet in 1577, as-well as a solar eclipse in 1582. There was also a significant earthquake which shook London during the week of Easter in 1580. He was fascinated by the apocalyptic prophecies of his day, and tried his own hand at them based on his knowledge of astrology. He believed the new age would begin perhaps in 1583 or 1584. In some of their later scrying experiments, the angels tell Dee and Kelley that “the tyme of God’s visitation” was supposedly “8.” Dee speculated that this might mean 1588, what seemed to be confirmed in further sessions. This year was already a focal point of widespread apocalyptic expectation across Europe due to various other circulating prophecies (like the one from Regiomontanus). All of this context, the anxiety and anticipation of the day, made the angels' messages about an impending universal transformation feel incredibly timely and divinely orchestrated. Dee likely saw himself, through this angelic guidance, as a key recipient of divine wisdom. That he was meant to help humanity navigate or prepare for these critical end times, perhaps even being heir to the prophetic biblical tradition of Enoch, Elias, Esdras, and John the Apostle.

At first, it seemed that they were more interested in the location of hidden treasure, which they basically pester the angels about endlessly. You may have been broke, but have you ever ignored an angel giving you the secrets of the universe so that you could be lead to buried treasure, asking them to loan you money for a horse? At one point the angels even had to scold them a little bit. Eventually, however, they learned to work the boys. Stringing them along with promises of treasure, like a carrot on a stick, they instead deliver to them the keys of all creation and the material to potentially prompt the apocalypse. These guys are like the Beavis and Butthead of the 16th century. Someone should make a movie about their misadventures. Harold and Kumar go to the angelic realm. 

On March 24th, 1583, the Archangel Raphael granted Kelley his first vision of what would eventually be called the Holy Book of Loagaeth. Edward began to see what he described as a booklet with forty-eight leaves(pages with both front and back), made of gold, and bound together. It appeared as though it were still wet, having been written with fresh blood. The letters and words were unrecognizable, some sort of foreign hieroglyphic alphabet, completely novel. Once Kelley had counted to forty-eight, Raphael confirmed his addition, while also hinting at something mysterious...

"It is finished. One is one (that) neither is, was, or shall be known."

Here he lets us in on a little known fact that there is another leaf, unknown, making the true total 49 - but not only that, that leaf is actually "one," making it the first leaf. Later on this first hidden enigmatic piece of celestial parchment was revealed to Kelley, but in that moment, Raphael informs the boys of its importance..

"It is not to be spoken, but in the time of His own time."

Given the theme of the day and its relation to the Book of Revelation, "His own time" is often seen as the promised Second Coming of Christ. That's right, to give you a sense of the importance of what is going down here...the first table was to be reserved for... well I'll let later words from angel Nalvage do the work...

"I find the soul of man hath no portion in this First Table. It is the Image of the Son of God, in the bosom of his father, before all the worlds. It comprehendeth his incarnation, passion, and return to judgment: which he himself, in flesh, knoweth not.**"

In Kelley's second vision of the book, a few days later, he was able to see that each page was made up of an enormous 49x49 grid,  49 columns, and 49 rows. The leaves were filled with letters, "some more than others." It was at this point that Raphael also began to draw out 21 hieroglyphic-esque characters from the book, what would make up the Angelical/Enochian alphabet. Later on, when they are actually revealed the first page, each box is filled with a word instead of a single letter, like the other 48 leaves. Kelley stating here "some more than others" essentially means that he is seeing the full 49 page book in its glory. Later on in the workings, Raphael states "As I have said: the 49 parts of this Book," confirming their premonitions.

So... imagine 98 pages of stuff that looks like this (with the first page even more cluttered)

![loga.png](/img/user/images/loga.png)
	(just wait until the angels hear about sudoku)

In Kelley's third vision of the Holy Book, he was able to catch a glimpse of its cover, which was blue in color, and made from a thin light silk. This title-page read "Amzes naghezes Hardeh"
Kelley reported that these words meant "The Universal Name of Him that created universally be praised and extolled forever." However, there seemed to be a bit of dispute about this, as an Angel named Ave, later in the journals, suggests that the book was entitled "Let Those that Fear God, and Are Worthy, Read."

To skip ahead a bit, the last messenger to greet the gang was Mother of the Angels Galvah. 
Before giving the final page of the book, she settles things...

"Touching the Book, it shall be called Logah: which in your language signifieth Speech from God. Write after this sort       L O A G A E T H: it is to be sounded Logah. This word is of great signification, I mean in respect of the profoundness thereof." 
	(A True and Faithful Relation, p. 19)

On Good Friday March 29th 1583, Kelley began to receive the text of these 49 leaves. The way they went about this... well, first Kelley got into a trance. Then... while staring into his crystal a "sword of flame" apparently came out of the shewstone and would plunge itself into Kelley's head. It was described "a thing immediately creeping within his head, and in that pang became all in a sweat." This was quite uncomfortable for him, but would ease itself after around 15 minutes, at which point Kelley would be in a state similar to shamanic ecstasy. Here he could read and speak with fluency the strange foreign language within this other-worldly literature, in a somewhat analogous manner to the traditional Christian "speaking in tongues" as a result of invoking the Holy Spirit. After their sessions, the fire would retreat from his skull and Kelley would lose these abilities. 

Archangel Raphael began to deliver the first lines of the first leaf in an arduous and meticulous manner. Remember that this initial 49x49 grid is filled with all words and not letters like the others. He would point to each box with a magical golden rod of his, and then spell out each word letter by letter. Kelley would speak these letters out loud for Dee to record in a painstaking manner. Taking into account both sides, that's a total of 4,800 words. Letter. by. l e t t e r. 

After making it through only 2 lines of the first page, 98 words deep (only 4,702 to go), Dee became concerned that this was going to take forever. The process was so laborious that even Dee, usually patient and pious, couldn’t help but complain. Asking if there was another way they could perhaps go about things, he aired his grievances to the angel Raphael, whom, apparently having little patience for mortal complaints, abruptly withdrew from the sessions. Taking his belongings with him, the vision of the Holy Book suddenly vanished from Kelley's sight as-well. After a little prayer of reconciliation on the part of Dee, Raphael showed back up to lecture the duo. Claiming the request was "inappropriate", Raphael wasn't going to show back up until the whole book was transmitted. He assured them, however, that his office would remain. The revelations from then on came solely as spoken dictation(a voice to Kelley in trance), without the benefit of Raphael’s guiding wand(although it was probably his voice). Dee however was, after all this trouble, able to get his request granted. The rest of the leaf was transmitted word by word instead of letter by letter. This took much of the workload off their shoulders, but, what came with that, was the sacrifice of having an exact spelling of the remaining words - only the phonetics would remain(which Dee did his best to make precise).

Another thing to be noted, is that this Enochian angelic language was to be read from right to left, similar to Hebrew/Aramaic. This was unique to Western magic, and John Dee had to figure this out himself. Later on he has his suspicion confirmed by Uriel, and then at the very end, Mother of the angels Galvah comes in to instruct Dee to rewrite the entirety of it all in reverse.

"The first leaf (as you call it) is the last of the book. ...  Write the book (after your order) backward, but alter not the form of the letters, I speak in respect of the places."
	A True and Faith and Relation, p. 191

How is it that these tables were meant to be used?
What are we doing crosswords here or something?

Well.... after copying them all out correctly, they are supposedly unlocked or opened using a series of 48 (or 49) calls. The first four of these came through slowly, and backwards, over multiple sessions(but with translations). One of these words, OM, seems to be a possible root for "to understand" or "to know." How'd the Hindu's beat em to this? Then calls 5-18 came through in a single hurried session without any English. The last 30, called the Aethyrs, came through in a single session as-well(being quite short). The first call, for the first table, was given to Dee hidden in plain sight during another session much earlier(a long string of text that ultimately doesn't make much sense). So... starting with the second table (remember the first is saved for Jesus), reciting these new keys, along with the use of the special angelic tools they made earlier, open up the power of the pages and pages of grids. Now the result of all of this isn't exactly clear, but, occultists have worked out that it either corresponds with, or possibly even prompts the apocalypse. 

Yup.

The Liber Logaeth is said to contain knowledge about the nature of God, the secret nature of the angels, but also, the speech which generated all of creation to come into existence. It was seen as a sort of final revelation for humankind, unifying and perfecting all religions - but also, in so doing, heralding in the apocalypse. The Liber Logaeth is supposed to be the final scripture, John Dee and Edward Kelley being the final prophets, their work, a text containing the divine speech which brought things into being, but also, what would be responsible for the beginning of its annihilation. It is said to contain the 7 seven days of creation, as-well as the dreaded 8th day of judgement.

Dee records the angel Raphael saying of the book that it contains: _"The Mysterie of our Creation, The Age of many years, and the conclusion of the World: and of all things, which are prefixed from the beginning: and are, or shall be to the end of the World."_ (This is from Dee's diaries, specifically the _Mysteriorum Libri Quinque_, detailing the reception of _Liber Loagaeth_).

“What I speak hath not byn reuealed, no not in these last tymes, of the second last world. But I begynne new worldes, new people, new kings, & new knowledge of a new Gouernment.” “New worlds, shall spring of these. New manners: strange men:” “The old ways cease, the new begin.”

The "language" of _Liber Loagaeth_ was not translated by the angels for Dee, unlike the later Enochian Calls. Its dense, patterned tables of letters appeared chaotic and incomprehensible. Dee himself wrote that the first leaf shown to him was so mysterious that it seemed to contain all knowledge but in an unformed, ungraspable state.

In 1587, while Dee and Kelley were living in Třeboň (in what is now the Czech Republic), Kelley claimed to have received a communication from angels named Madimi and Ill. This angelic message reportedly instructed Dee and Kelley to **exchange wives** as a means of furthering their philosophical and spiritual partnership. John Dee, however hesitant, seemed to be able to confirm that this was what was being said. Could this have been a test of sorts, or had they been working with demons/fallen angels all along? Dee from all counts drove this man for hours and hours, scrying as though he were an addicted, deranged task master. Perhaps this was a sort of 
"fuck you," "I'm done with this," so that he could get  back to his alchemy work, potentially his sanity. Frustrated and going crazy, could he have made up this fake command in hopes that Dee would get angry and fire him? "Angels like....totally told me that we have to exchanges wives or whatever.... and like..... share everything else too. Sorry man, I don't make the rules, but you've gotta let me sleep w your wife."

livin la liber logaeth

Following through, it seems their lives took quite a quality decline, and the two could no longer work with one another. It is even hypothesized that the child Dee's wife gave birth to.... around 9 months after this period.... may have actually been Edward Kelley's(although John raised little Theodore with love as if he were one of his own). A pioneer in the world of scrying and swinging, it seems that golden coins may not have been the only form of booty which Edward was interested in. 

Could a malicious order have been slipped in there as a test to see if they have the ability to defy it and prove their righteousness? Could their elevated state have opened them to a higher dimensional field in which this negative influence may have the capacity to enter, and the continuance of such work would demand a consciousness that is immune to these devilish prompts to survive? In [[The Ra Contact\|The Ra Contact]], during channeling sessions, it seems the group faced off against a negatively oriented 5th dimensional entity which would attempt to cause as much chaos and issues as possible, with the intention of separating the group and stopping the working. 

It's a matter of debate as to whether Dee and Kelley fully understood the implications of the system they were receiving, or the ultimate intentions of the spiritual entities they were communicating with. Dee approached the work with piety and a desire for wisdom, to benefit mankind. Kelley was a more complex and perhaps reluctant participant at times. Some theorize that the two were essentially the instru­ments where­by the rit­u­al for­mu­la for ini­ti­at­ing the apoc­a­lypse would be plant­ed in the midst of human­i­ty. If the apoc­a­lypse were to take place, and if it were nec­es­sary for human beings to open the gates of the Watch­tow­ers.... before that could all occur, the angels first had to instruct man on the cor­rect method for open­ing the gates. Here, hiding in plain sight, it would sit like a ticki­ng occult time bomb, wait­ing for some powerful magi­cian, possibly the second coming of Christ, through divinely orchestrated guid­ance, to work it. Some see the theurgic operation comparable to opening the seven seals from the Book of Revelation.

Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. 2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” 3 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. 4 I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 5 Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
	Revelation 5:1-5

Dee nev­er received the sig­nal to con­duct the Apoc­a­lypse work­ing in his life­time. There is no evidence that either him nor Kelley engaged in the material which they brought forth. 
That was to be reserved for anoth­er cen­tu­ry and anoth­er man.... 

I'm sorry guys.
I didn't realize what I had gotten myself into until it was too late. 
But I may have accidentally started the apocalypse. 

I had discovered this author during my studies of Kundalini. His book on the subject was pretty good, it synthesized much what surrounded the topic in a single location. He had another book which preceded it, discussing the link between the Eastern Kundalini and the Western Mystery Traditions. 
	https://www.amazon.com/MAGUS-KUNDALINI-Complete-Spirituality-Mysteries/dp/177706080X

Towards the end of the book it contained the Enochian calls/keys. I had begun going through these perhaps 6 months prior, just 1 of them every once and a while. I didn't really place much importance on the calls, and was not really educated on the subject at all - other than the fact that I associated it with Enoch - and it must somehow be related to kundalini. As I began to go through the calls, it became clear to me that there may be a level to this which was in-fact legitimate. In the days or two proceeding, I could catch my pupils in the mirror, dilated as though I were on some sort of drug. I would feel incredibly intense emotions. I considered it to be potentially sparking activations of some kind of metaphysical nature beyond logical understanding within my subconscious. I was somewhat used to this, having been into kundalini yoga/other systems for the last few years. During this time I had begun experimenting with the content of numerous different spiritual systems, like the 72 Shem Angels, special Sanskrit chants, etc. so I wasn't able to directly link all of my experience to the calls. However, I remember just how profoundly my spiritual journey began to accelerate when I heard the word Enoch from my father, in random conversation, during one of the most intense emotional moments of my life, years ago, which activated me, as described in [[Prequel𓂀/0. Sequence of Events 1\|0. Sequence of Events 1]], something I would not forget. 

![Pasted image 20250524162955.png](/img/user/images/Gematria/Pasted%20image%2020250524162955.png)
The phonetics of a certain word within these calls, "Babage," (which seems to mean South)  
emphasized a pronunciation of "Bah-Bah-Jee."

This held particular importance for me because it seemed to parallel [[Babaji\|Babaji]] - a being whom I believed had reached out, made contact with, and began to guide me from a distance(around 3 years ago now). I perceived this individual to perhaps be an immortal being that lived within the Himalayan mountains, and given the history of the subject, that he guides prophets, myself potentially in the beginning stages of a new career.

As-well, as I begin to study more deeply into the topic, is seemed that Nalvage
is somewhat similar to Nagaraj, which is an alternate name for Babaji... or according to Sri M, a being whom Babaji was at-least in contact with. Just something I found interesting...

![Pasted image 20250529172646.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250529172646.png)

I should note there is a growing theory that scholars have begun to formulate over recent years... that John Dee simple made all of this up. Some of his notes hint that he knew others would eventually look back and glance through his grand archive of work. The only logical conclusion which investigators would be forced to come to, is that Dee's nuts. Playing the long game, all the way from the 15th century, here we have stumbled upon the worlds first Deez Nutz, etching its place in records of human history from the celestial kingdom itself. *goteeeeem*

The Enochian magic system was later adopted into the work of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This work was later adopted and revised by the worlds most famous occultist Aleister Crowley. He is largely responsible for the surge of popularity in this otherwise mostly forgotten and neglected renaissance work. Aleister Crowley, who identified himself as the beast 666 from the Book of Revelation(a nickname from his mother in childhood), worked through the entire system and reorganized it. He famously scried the final 30 keys, the Aethyrs, backwards from the system Dee received, on a trip through the Northern Algerian desert in 1909. Well, actually he began the first two keys in the year 1900 in Mexico, but ultimately drifted away from them. During this intermission, he "channeled" his most famous and important piece of work, "The Book of the Law." 

This entire process began on the 16th of March in 1904, when Crowley was attempting the "Bornless Ritual" with his wife, Rose, while spending the night in the Kings Chamber of the Great Pyramid of Giza. On an extended honeymoon, he was attempting to "shew the Sylphs," aka show the air-spirits/fairies, to his new wife(a thoughtful gift). She was not able to perceive anything, but did enter into a bit of a trance, repeatedly saying "They're waiting for you!" Rose lacked much interest in the occult or magic, and so, didn't think much of it. However, two days later, after Crowley performed an invocation to Thoth, she seemed to pop back into mediumship mode and dial in a bit as to who it was waiting for Crowley, revealing their identity by name.... Horus. 

Crowley was a bit skeptical, not sure if she was pulling his leg or whatnot, and asked her numerous questions about Horus. Rose passed his interrogations and was able to answer, accurately, multiple questions, supposedly without having any prior study of the subject. As part of his testing, Crowley took his wife on a romantic stroll through the Bulaq museum, located in Cairo Egypt. Here he quizzed her, asking Rose to point to images of Horus. Crowley was amused as they walked through the display of artwork all around them, his wife missing numerous opportunities to point to imagery which would validate her claims. However, the two went upstairs and, from across the room, she correctly pointed at and identified the falcon headed figure on the stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu. Not only was she able to prove herself, but also, in a profoundly uncanny twist of events, it seemed that the item she was pointing at was catalogued under inventory number 666... a number of profound significance for Crowley(later changed moving museums). 

![666tablet 1.png](/img/user/images/666tablet%201.png)

Aleister immediately commissioned a curator at the museum to help translate the inscriptions into French/English. Eventually, Rose revealed that her "informant" was not Horus himself, but actually his messenger, Aiwass, a secret chief of a very senior celestial grade. Soon after the translation was finished, on April 7th 1904(4-7-1904), Rose informed her husband that he was to go and sit in his temple at exactly noon on April 8th, 9th, and 10th. He was to write down everything that he heard until exactly 1 o'clock, and then leave. Crowley followed these orders, and on the appointed hour, of the appointed day, at the appointed location, sat before his temple table with pen and paper in hand. When the clock struck 12, a voice began to speak to Crowley from over his left shoulder. The voice was "of deep timbre, musical and expressive," and began to relay spiritual dictation which Aleister found difficult to keep pace with. At exactly 1:00, the voice stopped, and so did Crowley. At the end of the three days, what was written were all three sections of what would be the central Magus of the Thelemic system, what was titled, "The Book of the Law." Later, in discussion with Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs, Crowley was introduced to the idea that “Aiwaz” might be the proper name of the god of the Yezidis, a Kurdish religious minority historically accused of being devil worshippers. Their chief divine figure, **Melek Taus**, also known as **Shaytan** or **Shaitan**, is associated with the Islamic Satan (Iblis). They embraced the then-popular but now disputed theory that the Yezidis worship Satan as a misunderstood or enlightened being, very similar to the Nag Hammadi Gnostics(who viewed the snake in the Garden as a messenger of the divine). This interpretation influenced Crowley to equate Aiwaz with Lucifer, not in the Christian sense of evil, but as the liberating, rebellious force—an archetype of spiritual independence and enlightenment.

Occultists say that it is normal for one to leave certain workings, returning back to their life, perhaps experiencing certain initiations, before they are called to return back and finish what they may actually now be ready for. This seemed to be the case for Crowley, whom after starting the aethyrs, was drawn to The Book of Law, his most important work. The first two aethyrs he scried were just prequels to a much larger picture that Crowley began to see. He came back to finish the rest during what was originally supposed to be a recreational trek through the desert. A trip with his friend, lover and student Victor Neuburg, the journey was originally just for enjoyment. However, Crowley had brought all of the items necessary, and found himself inspired, to undertake a scrying aether journey through the desert. He would sit under the stars, and with Victor, report his visions. By the time Aleister had gotten down to the final 9 aethyrs, he received guidance to recite Surah 112 of the Koran 1001 times per day, bowing in-between each recitation(what must have been physically grueling). The visions that came through Crowley's scrying sessions showed up in an apocalyptic, very King's Jamesian style manner(reminisent of what he grew up around). These visions are what would make up his book, published in 1911, titled "The Vision and the Voice." 

Aleister Crowley's _The Vision and the Voice_ and _The Book of the Law_ are his two most significant works, and that which forms the cornerstone of Thelemic philosophy. The Book of Law declares the end of the Aeon of Osiris (associated with patriarchal religions like Christianity) and the dawn of the Aeon of Horus, marked by spiritual autonomy and direct communion with the divine. This was seen to liberate humanity from submission to external gods, replacing them with self-directed spiritual growth. A time of the "crowned and conquering child", symbolic for youthful potential unburdened by past limitations. Crowley was heralding in a new era which would require individuals to reject herd mentality and embrace their own divine nature, dismantling outdated religious structures in favor of individualized spiritual paths.

The Vision and the Voice is filled with imagery that Crowley experienced utilizing the Enochian system of magic, scrying the aethyrs, which ultimately represented and described the transition of the world into this new age of Horus. Through a series of visionary journeys, Crowley encountered powerful archetypes, spiritual trials, and revelations that both illustrated and deepened the themes introduced in The Book of the Law. Here the aspirant is confronted with the dissolution of the ego, the crossing of the Abyss, and the embrace of one’s True Will—experiences that embody the spiritual autonomy and self-realization at the heart of the new era. Together, these two works offer both the declaration and the experiential unfolding of Thelema’s revolutionary vision for humanity.

Now, why does this matter? 
Well, if I am that Phaoroh fella,
it should be noted, that his mother, 
Cleopatra, viewed herself as an incarnation of Isis,
and her son, Pizza Pizza VX,
was viewed as an incarnation of Horus.
Here's a statue of the little guy being
overshadowed by an enormous falcon,
associated with Horus, to prove it to you.

I found some excerpts from Aleister Crowleys Vision and the Voice, specically, "The Cry of the 14th Aethyr, Which is Called UTI", to be interesting.

"And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake. The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. On his Forehead is a star, but all about him is darkness, and the crying of beasts. And there are lamps moving in the darkness.

And the Angel says: Depart! For thou must invoke me only in the darkness. Therein will I appear, and reveal unto thee the Mystery of UTI. For the Mystery thereof is great and terrible. And it shall not be spoken in sight of the sun.

Therefore I withdraw myself. 

December 3, 2:50-3:15 p.m."
....
around 6 and a half hours go by until around 9:45 p.m...

"The Angel re-appears.

The blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, so oppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would be like bright light beside it.

His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates of Understanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg? Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.

I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light. I am the sightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with desolation. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the darkness of the earth is ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but the darkness of the soul is utter blackness... "

The famous axioms which sum up the entirety of Thelema...

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
along with
"Love is the law, love under will."

Later that night I discovered that a music producer I am a fan of had dropped a new project. Listening to it, I found myself navigating to their twitter. I scrolled a bit and saw that they were making fun of a SoundCloud group which made their members do a ritual in order to join. 

![Pasted image 20250519231003.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020250519231003.png)

I thought that was funny and wanted to see what sort of music people like that were creating. I went, looked it up, and glanced through some of what they had. It was thematically dark content, somewhat in alignment with how the night was already proceeding. One of the artists apart of this collective was 2 Shanez. This was particularly alluring for me because my name is Shane, and I've had the original gamertag Two Chainz on Xbox live since I was 11 or 12 - able to pass as the rapper in the world of Halo and Call of Duty lobbies my entire life. I was the original 2 Shanez, but it seemed that someone had picked up on the swagger I developed in the ether and attempted to create a rap career out of it. Looking through their songs, they weren't necessarily that good, some had nice beats, but the vocals... I wasn't necessarily a fan of. 

Eventually I got to this one.

Come on, this was a bit spooky, myself still riding out this Adderall, it felt so... predetermined? 
Notable lyrics,
"For me to tell you how I feel better pop my addy (pop that addy)  
And i feel that they sleepin on me" 
Part of the main chorus of the song is talking about "my chain," and the night prior, my brother was showing me a gold chain that he had thoroughly regretted spending 7k on.

Unfortunately, further research revealed that things didn't end up working out for poor 2 Shanez. The ****ᶜᵒᵘᵍʰ**** ᵖᵒˢᵉʳ ****ᶜᵒᵘᵍʰ****  artist is now facing life in prison for murder. 
I don't know if this was about him or not,
it wasn't me(although perhaps I've repressed the memory),
and I'm not sure how many white children named Shane have embraced this pseudonym, 
but in my investigations,
I came across this...

The next day I went to Trader Joes. I ended up seeing someone that I had became friends with there, and got into a conversation. Eventually he was called to work register and told me he'd see me over there. I finished my shopping and navigated over to the open stand he was posted up at. We talked about a smoked gouda quesadilla which he had created earlier that week, how the idea for it was inspired by first recommending the tasty dairy product to a customer(give and you shall receive). Before you know it, he was done scanning my haul, and the total was $27.77. An accident of some kind happened, and the employee discount button was pressed by the slip of a finger(20%), and my new total came down to $22.22. Checking the receipt, it seemed that the glitch ended up creating a $5.55 discount. You can do the math yourself, the perfection of this is specific sequence of numbers is beyond my comprehension. I am not certain how many other combinations would elicit repeating numerals in the same manner.

My brother and I both decided to do Adderall again in our gardening session the next weekend, 
I mean, there's a lot to get to if we've only got 4 years left. It was Mothers Day weekend, an occasion which our Mother was out of town for, so we finished the night by taking our Grandmother to dinner at Panera Bread. 
I checked the receipt.
How interesting...

On that night, the last time I probably ever take Adderall, Two Shane's came face to face and were conversing with one another. 

Worst case scenario, if this thing did fly directly into the planet, the good news is, it wouldn't be powerful enough to take us all out. It would be strong, around 10,000 megatons of TNT strong, over 100,000+ Hiroshima bombs strong, enough to take out a small city like London strong, but it wouldn't separate the sphere in two. If it were to land in water, sure, we may see some 800 ft tsunamis or something, and yeah, maybe they destroy the coastlines of multiple countries, but, we will survive(some of us). 

Anyway, I'm going to let this one rest for a bit. Give it some time to simmer on the backburner. 
Let's say we take this back up on the night of Thursday April 12th 2029, shall we?
Should give us plenty of time to start thinking of a plan.

Cheers 🥂

It would only be right to finish things out with the quote 
which closed the 1994 TV movie "Without Warning."

The film aired on CBS the night before Halloween, depicting a sudden asteroid crisis through the realistic lens of news broadcasts. It was designed to mimic live reports, capturing the world's escalating panic as catastrophe began to unfold (and indeed it caused some panic amongst those who didn't know they were watching a movie). In Fort Smith Arkansas, their local CBS station received dozens of calls from people concerned the events were actually occurring. The area's ABC, Fox, and NBC stations were also receiving calls from people complaining and wondering why they weren't covering the same events as CBS(despite every commercial break making it clear that it was fiction). 

As radar picks up on a plethora of asteroids(really its an alien invasion, spoiler) beginning to rain down upon the planet, a knowingness that it is the end begins to sink into the awareness of the News Anchor. 

He leaves the viewers with one final quote from Shakespeare, 
the words of poet to ponder as their annihilation is unfolding... 

"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves"
	_The Tragedy of Julius Caesar_
