Kabbala was kept secret sorta hush hush amongst the elites
but it eventually begins to be taught in public...
Why?
Because they think the world is coming to an end
The 1492 Alhambra Degree was the beginning of the end of the world and  in order to usher in the messiah, Kabbala began to be taught widespread. 




The Tree of Life 


The tree is made up of ten spiritual principles, or sefirot, that are united in a mystical state called Da'at. In Da'at, all sefirot are one, sharing and revealing the Divine Light.

The middle pillar of the tree symbolizes cosmic forces flowing invisibly beneath the surface - like sap flowing through its trunk and branches

"In brief, the Tree of Life is a compendium of science, psychology,
philosophy, and theology." — Dion Fortune


Kabbalah literally means “reception” or “receiving.”


The word Kabbalah is a feminine noun and comes from the Hebrew root Qof-Beit-Lamed (קבל), which means "to receive" or "to accept."

The creator is constantly giving. 
And giving at 100%, withholding nothing 
Why am I not receiving?
I don’t have the vessel
I don’t have the capacity 
There is negativity, blockages which are in the way - preventing us from receiving the beneficence that is always there - always present. 
Slowly  we come to the place where we can overcome ourselves.
Where we can overcome bad habit
Overcome our negative judgement
and make the blessings more constant.  

The word, Qabalah, originates from the Hebrew "QBL," meaning "an oral
tradition." The Qabalah is the esoteric component of Judaism, referred to
by Dion Fortune as the "Yoga of the West."


A person who studies Kabbalah is called a mekubal, which means "one who receives."

“My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”  
	- Nikola Tesla

Within the tradition, 

We experience God as Shekinah, it’s feminine aspect. 




"For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to pure speech, that all of them may call upon the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord"
	Zephaniah 3:9 

In the Sefer Yetzirah(The Book of Formation), a foundational Kabbalistic text, it states that Being emerges from divine language. God used the 22 letters, along with the 10 _Sefirot_ (divine emanations), to create existence. The Hebrew letters are the DNA of the universe, the building blocks of reality. They are the physical representation of the divine energy intelligence that created everything, from the planets to the galaxies. Each month is represented by a sign of the zodiac, and by a planet, both created by a Hebrew letter. The Book of Formation explains that by meditating daily on the Hebrew letters specific to the month, you can influence how your month plays out. How one speaks becomes important. Because we hold the capacity for speech, if we speak correctly, we can bend reality to our will. We can see this near its upper bound within the concept of the golem. Perhaps you've heard of Frankenstein... The Sefer Yetzirah lays out a procedure by which one can bring to life an inanimate object. Rabbis were supposedly able to fashion and mold clay into a form, perform a ritual involving the recitation of divine names and specific letter combinations, and bring an object to life. This could be as a calf, a human being, birds, perhaps a gazelle, even plant life. In Midrash and Talmudic sources, Adam is initially created as a golem (גולם) when his dust is "kneaded into a shapeless husk," afterwards being fashioned into a body and then having the soul "breathed into him." No anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. 

Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, has a tradition of attributing significance to letters as-well. Ilm al-Huruf (عِلْم الْحُرُوف) (the science of letters), lays out the science of the special qualities of each of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, as well as their diverse qualities when combined with one another, similar to what is described in the Sepher Yetzirah. What is very interesting is that both the Arabic language and the Hebrew language start with alif/alef.

Bat-Kol (בת קול) Literally means "daughter of a voice" in Hebrew, and is generally manifested as a voice delivering a Divine message proclaiming God's will or judgment. It's a more indirect and less authoritative form of divine communication compared to prophecy, often being understood as an actual auditory phenomenon – a voice that could be heard. The _Bat Kol_ is sometimes described as an “echo” of the Divine voice, although the nature of the “echo” cannot be described in normal terms. Bat (בת) means daughter, while Kol (קול) translates to voice/sound, so the sound is not a direct voice from heaven; rather it is a voice that is derivative, heard indirectly, like an echo. One of the primary characteristics of the _Bat Kol_ is the invisibility of the speaker. A voice is heard and no man is seen, there is zero visual accompaniment. The nature of the audible quality of the _Bat Kol_ varies. Sometimes it is a quiet voice, in other moments it is a grand, reverberating, and booming voice. In some contexts the word “_bat kol_” was simply understood as “sound,” not originating in the created universe, but proceeding from God. It was sometimes regarded as being spoken by an angel, especially Gabriel(the divine messenger), and as such is the “echo” of God's communication. 





They would summon beings to teach you things rapidly

Kabbalah describes angels as emissaries of divine will, each governing specific cosmic functions. Invoking them was not about "summoning" in a coercive sense but _attuning_ to their energy to receive guidance or protection.


Shattered Vessels

"The shattering of the vessels" (in Hebrew, "_Shevirat haKeilim_")

Isaac Luria believed that when God created the world, he did so by forming vessels to hold the Divine Light. The 10 _Sefirot_, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, were developed. As the light began to fill these vessels, there came a point where they were unable to contain all of the divinity... they shattered. Sparks of Divine light were trapped in the different shards of these vessels as they scattered throughout the cosmos and formed our world. The job which humanity is tasked to accomplish is reunite the scattered sparks of Light, to repair the broken world, and thus participate in finishing God’s work. 


According to Luria, the ten vessels that were originally meant to contain the emanation of God's light were unable to contain that light and were hence either displaced or shattered. As a result of this cosmic catastrophe, the Sefirot, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, are shattered and out of place, and the world within which we reside, is composed of the shards of the these broken values.

Luria's Kabbala was both a refusal and an extension of the reigning kabbalistic ideas during his time. His system is a fully developed, although not always coherent, analysis of the seder hishtalshelut, aka the order of development, or the order of evolution, as a spiraling cycle of hitpashtut (egression) and histallekut (regression). 

The heart of the system is this dialectical structure where everything is happening all at once, yet at the same time everything is also being erased. There is this constant movement to and fro where the world is on one hand becoming exiled, but simultaneously on the other, it is being redeemed. You don't know quite where you are in time and space. 




the system is so dynamic and it's it's almost like a fractal that the more you zoom in on a region of the fractal the

Tikkun Olam

ruach ha-kodesh

Tikkun Olam

Bhagavad Gita 15:1-5

The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.

The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.

The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.

One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.

"Thou art the tree of the world (whose roots extend upwards and branches hang downwards). Thou art the banian"
-Mahabarata (Page 1,950)


Odin's self-sacrifice. He sacrificed his eye in Mimir's well and he threw himself on his spear Gungnir in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then **hanged himself in Yggdrasil, the tree of life, for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes**.

Nathan of Gaza - The Tortured Soul of the Messiah

Plunged into the deepest depths of the Qlippoth, into the hellish torment of the parasitism at the
very abyss of non-existence is the tortured soul of the Messiah, wrestling with the horrid Dragon of the depths. In some of the more extreme passages it appears that the soul of the Messiah even began as an aspect of this horrid Dragon of the depths, although Nathan of Gaza never seems to fully commit to this idea. 

the fuel upon which the parasitic qlippoth feed, being so far from the Divine Light these righteous souls are actually necessary for the Demonic husks to maintain any existence at all - plunged into the very abyss, near non-being, these bright sparks are like fuel cells which prevent the qlippoth from tattering off into pure non-existence

those settled into the depths of the tahiru could only be released from the
clutches of the qlippoth by an act of cunning or Divine trickery or fraud to trick the forces of evil into releasing those really righteous Souls

this was primarily done by the Divine destining those souls to undergo or commit a deed in their life so awful or morally outrageous that the forces of the qlippoth thought that that this would actually allow them to both feed off of them in this primeval period but also because such horrible deeds will eventually be committed they could also recapture these various powerful souls and thus return them to the depths of the Abyss having committed such Dreadful misdeeds to feed on them forever

However

Engagement with the Qlippoth (evil forces) was actually a divine plan to redeem(Tikkun) the trapped sparks, thereby tricking the Qlippoth into allowing their own undoing.

Resolution of evil into good through the process of redemption

The Messiah’s apparent transgressions were reinterpreted as sacred actions, necessary to dismantle evil from within. 

Minor sins relatively speaking would be overcome by a huger Arc of redemption the Divine had planned - hese apparent sins would actually allow these very powerful Souls a kind of escape velocity from the forces of the qlippoth by engaging in a higher degree of Redemptive work

the talmud has it the more righteous a person is the more tortured by sin they are

 struggling with the worst of the forces of the qlippoth would eventually emerge from those depths but the clepotic influence will remain so profound that he would undergo the heights of divine illumination followed by the depths of soul-crushing sorrow

initial sin giving way to a greater Arc of redemption but they're tortured sojourn in the realm of the clepote leaves it behind a kind of Scar upon their very being such they have a tendency towards such sins and actually Delight in them are are indifferent to such devilish Behavior

but once he's undergone both radical evil and radical good he dialectically rises above both and ascends to the very Realm of the Divine itself

 in transcending his soul as the suffering job the Messiah becomes the chief power over the abyss itself

Evil is tricked into enabling its own undoing, and the mystic becomes a divine double agent, navigating paradox to heal a broken world. 

a cosmic warrior who
Deliberately enters spiritual darkness, risking personal corruption to redeem the whole.
the mission remains hidden from both the uninitiated and the Qlippoth.

In Kabbalah, a "lightning flash" symbolizes the sudden, powerful flow of divine energy, often represented as light, that moves through the Sefirot (divine emanations) on the Tree of Life. Signifying the rapid transmission of spiritual illumination and insight; it is typically depicted as a lightning bolt.



72 Names of God: Technology for the Soul

The 72 Names are each 3-letter sequences that act like an index to specific, spiritual frequencies; believed to possess certain spiritual powers as combinations of divine energies that can help with healing, protection, and other spiritual endeavors as they help us focus and use the gifts of the Spirit.

Within the Torah, we find that there are three consecutive verses from Exodus, each with 72 letters, found in chapter 14, verses 19-21.
