Early stages


Kabbala was kept secret sorta hush hush amongst the elites
but it eventually begins to be taught in public...
Why?
Because they think the world is coming to an end
The 1492 Alhambra Degree was the beginning of the end of the world and  in order to usher in the messiah, Kabbala began to be taught widespread. 




The Tree of Life 

"In brief, the Tree of Life is a compendium of science, psychology,
philosophy, and theology." — Dion Fortune


Kabbalah literally means “reception” or “receiving.”


The word Kabbalah is a feminine noun and comes from the Hebrew root Qof-Beit-Lamed (קבל), which means "to receive" or "to accept."

The word, Qabalah, originates from the Hebrew "QBL," meaning "an oral
tradition." The Qabalah is the esoteric component of Judaism, referred to
by Dion Fortune as the "Yoga of the West."


A person who studies Kabbalah is called a mekubal, which means "one who receives."

“My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”  
	- Nikola Tesla

Within the tradition, 

We experience God as Shekinah, it’s feminine aspect. 


"For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples to pure speech, that all of them may call upon the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord"
	Zephaniah 3:9 

In the Sefer Yetzirah(The Book of Formation), a foundational Kabbalistic text, it states that Being emerges from divine language. God used the 22 letters, along with the 10 _Sefirot_ (divine emanations), to create existence. The Hebrew letters are the DNA of the universe, the building blocks of reality. They are the physical representation of the divine energy intelligence that created everything, from the planets to the galaxies. Each month is represented by a sign of the zodiac, and by a planet, both created by a Hebrew letter. The Book of Formation explains that by meditating daily on the Hebrew letters specific to the month, you can influence how your month plays out. How one speaks becomes important. Because we hold the capacity for speech, if we speak correctly, we can bend reality to our will. We can see this near its upper bound within the concept of the golem. Perhaps you've heard of Frankenstein... The Sefer Yetzirah lays out a procedure by which one can bring to life an inanimate object. Rabbis were supposedly able to fashion and mold clay into a form, perform a ritual involving the recitation of divine names and specific letter combinations, and bring an object to life. This could be as a calf, a human being, birds, perhaps a gazelle, even plant life. In Midrash and Talmudic sources, Adam is initially created as a golem (גולם) when his dust is "kneaded into a shapeless husk," afterwards being fashioned into a body and then having the soul "breathed into him." No anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. 

Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, has a tradition of attributing significance to letters as-well. Ilm al-Huruf (عِلْم الْحُرُوف) (the science of letters), lays out the science of the special qualities of each of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, as well as their diverse qualities when combined with one another, similar to what is described in the Sepher Yetzirah. What is very interesting is that both the Arabic language and the Hebrew language start with alif/alef.

Bat-Kol (בת קול) Literally means "daughter of a voice" in Hebrew, and is generally manifested as a voice delivering a Divine message proclaiming God's will or judgment. It's a more indirect and less authoritative form of divine communication compared to prophecy, often being understood as an actual auditory phenomenon – a voice that could be heard. The _Bat Kol_ is sometimes described as an “echo” of the Divine voice, although the nature of the “echo” cannot be described in normal terms. Bat (בת) means daughter, while Kol (קול) translates to voice/sound, so the sound is not a direct voice from heaven; rather it is a voice that is derivative, heard indirectly, like an echo. One of the primary characteristics of the _Bat Kol_ is the invisibility of the speaker. A voice is heard and no man is seen, there is zero visual accompaniment. The nature of the audible quality of the _Bat Kol_ varies. Sometimes it is a quiet voice, in other moments it is a grand, reverberating, and booming voice. In some contexts the word “_bat kol_” was simply understood as “sound,” not originating in the created universe, but proceeding from God. It was sometimes regarded as being spoken by an angel, especially Gabriel(the divine messenger), and as such is the “echo” of God's communication.

Kabbalah describes angels as emissaries of divine will, each governing specific cosmic functions. Invoking them was not about "summoning" in a coercive sense but _attuning_ to their energy to receive guidance or protection.


Shattered Vessels

"The shattering of the vessels" (in Hebrew, "_Shevirat haKeilim_")

Isaac Luria believed that when God created the world, he did so by forming vessels to hold the Divine Light. The 10 _Sefirot_, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, were developed. As the light began to fill these vessels, there came a point where they were unable to contain all of the divinity... they shattered. Sparks of Divine light were trapped in the different shards of these vessels as they scattered throughout the cosmos and formed our world. The job which humanity is tasked to accomplish is reunite the scattered sparks of Light, to repair the broken world, and thus participate in finishing God’s work.

According to Luria, the ten vessels that were originally meant to contain the emanation of God's light were unable to contain that light and were hence either displaced or shattered. As a result of this cosmic catastrophe, the _Sefirot_, the archetypal values through which the cosmos was created, are shattered and out of place, and the world within which we reside, is composed of the shards of the these broken values.

Luria's Kabbala was both a refusal and an extension of the reigning kabbalistic ideas during his time. His system is a fully developed, although not always coherent, analysis of the seder hishtalshelut, aka the order of development, or the order of evolution, as a spiraling cycle of hitpashtut (egression) and histallekut (regression). 

The heart of the system is this dialectical structure where everything is happening all at once, yet at the same time everything is also being erased. There is this constant movement to and fro where the world is on one hand becoming exiled, but simultaneously on the other, it is being redeemed. You don't know quite where you are in time and space.




the system is so dynamic and it's it's almost like a fractal that the more you zoom in on a region of the fractal the
