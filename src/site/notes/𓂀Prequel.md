Discovering The Nine

Thich Nhat Hanh's death occurring the night I was initiated into the Melchizedek Priesthood

Thoth/Hermes/Enoch/Babaji's psychic introduction, and nonlocal guidance 

Discovering my past life, like... actually discovering my past life.... multiple past lives. 
(The hilarious moment when I was forced to learn Internal Family Systems)
