Dear John, 

I was down by the river earlier this week when I came across a marking that was left on a fallen tree beside the shore. I've been going there a lot lately, its been medicine for me. Amongst the rocks which bordered the edge of the watery rapids sat a trunk with the letters J + S on its surface. In my first few visits to the spot, I didn't notice, and when I eventually did observe, it got about 30 seconds of my attention. Oh look, a cute couple of lovebirds must have been here, I thought. James and Sara hit the rapids. Just 11 days ago, there was a new upload by Dr Sledge on the historical Jesus. Learning about the real story, I discovered that Jesus was never alone. He wasn't some profound perfect holy divine superhero who could hold the world on his back, but he had a partner in crime. The historical Jesus thought that the world was about to end, and I know we haven't seen each other in a while, but to update you on things, [[𓋹 The End 𓆙\|𓋹 The End 𓆙]], I think that could be potentially where we're headed. I've been disorderly.... not a complete wastebin, but I find myself wondering who the hell placed all of this in my hands? It's like nuclear codes were handed to Ed from Good Burger (home of the Good Burger)..... can I actually take this order? Maybe not alone. When I learned all this, it finally made sense. The last few months I've constantly asked myself in different situations, what would John do? I'm not fit to run this operation by myself. It's always been a dual setup. Wait a second... what was that on the tree again? The letters caught me off guard, simple and stationary, yet somehow alive — like the tree itself had been waiting for me to notice. Was it you who left this here for me to find when the time was right?

In the story which history holds, everything began with John recruiting Jesus into a leadership position within his movement, something called "The Way." When looking back, I realize you had also recruited me into "The Way." You handed me a little booklet you had printed yourself — the Tao Te Ching, with a cover you drew by hand. It wasn’t just ink and paper; it was initiation. For the three years we worked together, the Tao was a guiding compass. After the destruction of my beloved chariot, as described in [[The Inner Garden/𖥱 Dedication\|𖥱 Dedication]], you gave me rides for the rest of the season, and the entire next year as-well. You weren't even after any gas money, and did it all with no complaints, even when I left you waiting out there while scrambling to get ready(which was often). Our subconscious was constantly being filled with the sounds of Chillstep Wayne Dyer Tao Te Ching readings, which opened our morning and lead our auditory experience from job-site to job-site. I remember we joked about this, in a Ugandan Knuckles manner, constantly asking one another, "Do u kno da wae?" In the same Way John once drew Jesus into his movement, you pulled me into a stream that was already flowing, something older than both of us, something eternal.

![IMG_7114.jpg| 400](/img/user/images/IMG_7114.jpg)

But it wasn’t only the current of the Tao you initiated me into. History says John didn’t just preach the Way — he carried people into it with water, pulling them down into the Jordan, and raising them up into something new. John, the Baptizer, held a heavily apocalyptic view that the worlds end was imminent, and people needed to be ritually immersed for the remission of their sins. John wasn’t just some background prophet paving the way for a superstar, and Jesus was not a pre-ordained messiah from birth in the way he is often portrayed. Instead, Jesus of Nazareth was drawn to the powerful message and apocalyptic movement of John the Baptist. He came to John initially as a disciple, accepting John's authority and his call for national repentance. After his own baptism, Jesus worked alongside him for a time. This is the part that is downplayed, a detail not found in the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. At the time, there was an expectation of two messiahs, a kingly warrior and a priestly teacher. John, with his priestly lineage and prophetic teachings fit the role of the priestly messiah. Jesus, on the other hand, fit the role of kingly warrior. The two carried out a joint baptizing campaign(D oh double G) before Jesus began his independent ministry. That river was the threshold, the place where Jesus stepped out of his old life and into the fire of his calling. And when I think about it now.....

Didn't we go down to the river and you baptized me one day? I don't remember what exactly happened, but it was shortly after we had met and begun working together in the summer of 2022. I told you stories about my psychedelic ventures, how I had pushed things a little far and couldn't stop thinking that I may be some sort of Jesus figure. I knew absolutely nothing about Jesus, or the story, but you had the priestly knowledge. Just like that, we took a trip to the water. Out of view from the world —no loud prophecy, just work clothes, sweat on our brows, and muddy boots. Maybe all we did was go down to the shore and joked about repeating the act, but I believe you at-least sprinkled some water over my head. Heaven bore witness, though the world was blind. It was like we had our own little secret story occurring underneath the day to day appearances kept up in the gardens. Maybe I was Jesus, maybe I wasn't, either way, only time will tell, and it didn't even matter all that much. Here we were in the present moment, having fun under the sun. Instead of dismissing what I was trying to say, you at-least listened to the tale, as fragmented as it was. I described to you a story where I perceived myself to be performing a literal exorcism while on 7 grams of mushrooms. The beginning part of the trip was all "you're jesus!" .... which then transformed into "and the world is ending!" and then next thing you know, my skin began to prickle as I felt the energetic presence of a demonic force. "What would Jesus do??" I asked myself ironically, believing earlier parts of the trip to be delusory from the high dose, trying to have fun with the situation I had gotten myself into. Now I know the historical Jesus to have had a bit of an exorcism phase, but then, I just stepped into character in a sort of mocking, impromptu manner, and began to command the demon to go into the light, to be released from this world, to find rest. This took place only a short while after I had unknowingly sorta automatically and intuitively summoned the literal devil upon myself to release from the quantum field of the world while meditating on MDMA, what I felt was a sad childish cope for a schizophrenic boy entering crisis, you said sounded exactly like the situation with Jesus in the Garden of Galilee. You helped me find safety in the psychosis, to help me believe in myself when I couldn't feel anything but confusion and agony. You gave merit to my voice, even though a lot of what came from it was quite absurd, you helped sift out the gems.

John’s teachings were about preparing for the end of the age through _sedaka_ — helping those in need, lifting up the poor, clothing the naked. This reminded me of the story you told me about bringing clothes to the homeless people downtown and sharing with them the energy of love. Even when that one guy accidentally blew a little bit of fentanyl smoke in your face and you had to retreat home for an impromptu naptime, you found joy in serving however you could. Sometimes when you pulled up, they thought you were a dealer of “the blues,” but you were carrying a different medicine entirely. Do you remember our idea for solving the drug epidemic? We could incentive dealers to secretly begin to lower the dosage of their substances and slowly ween off clientele until they are strictly on placebos and completely sober. The community wouldn't even know what hit them, a secret liberation, a hidden grace.

It’s funny how our names tell the whole story. You’ve got John and Shane, both coming from that same root in Hebrew, Yohanan, which means 'God is gracious.' There's this shared theme of blessing right at the core of things. But then you get to our last names, Thornton and Boaquist—the place of thorns and the settlement of twigs. It grounds the whole thing in something real and rough. It’s not just grace; it’s grace growing out in the wild, through all the sharp and pokey parts.

The original John came from a priestly family, but rejected the temple (which he viewed as corrupt) and chose to live in the wilderness instead. This reminds me of the stories you told about how tortuous your formative years in the Mormon church were, how you grew to view them as a cult and that your family was all brainwashed and stuck inside it. You turned away from false temples to find what was real. This led you to your own time in the wilderness. Perhaps that meant a week in the alleyways downtown, or maybe it meant sleeping at a place like that public park we'd take bathroom breaks at frequently. Even when living back at home you were choosing to live in a tent in the backyard instead of in the house. You chose to embrace the elements, to surrender to them. 

11:11 would show up all the time, it actually became a bit of a gag at work while we were gardening. 
Maaan this is taking forever... what time is it? 11:11. 
Alright everyone, we're done at this house, let's make sure to clock out before we head to the next one (aaaand it's 11:11). 
*ding* Oooh, I just got a text back from the client on what to do with all this Oregon Grape ... (11:11) 
Hahaha that's hilarious it reminds me of this video I have to show you, where's my pho... ahh there it is (11:11)

Matthew 11:11 - "Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he"

I still remember the moment in which you found that news article about a woman in Tennessee who was diagnosed by her doctor with a ghetto booty. She was so upset and felt called out, but we both knew that doctor meant no harm, he was just telling it how it was. Ghetto booty, as we talked about, would really be perceived as a compliment by many.

What was that dream you shared with me one time? We were climbing up the outside of a stained-glass church to break inside so that we could clean it. At a certain point, you kept going, but I had fallen down the side of the building and died. I resurrected, came back to life, and met you on the inside. All this in a floating body of light, just to let you know that I had overcome death. That was tripping me out when you told me that, like the dream world was trying to say something... I never flat out tried to claim the identity... that was too crazy... in-fact we stayed away from discussions like that. It was always a - I maybe potentially possibly theoretically could be experiencing this phenomenon, which may have these implications, but it could also be all these other things, lets discuss.... For the dream realm, notable in its symbological magic, to relay this sort of idea back to us directly, was quite profound...

 I also remember you talking to me about the brother of Youtuber Demolition Ranch who died of cancer and documented his journey online. Just a few days later, someone tries to assassinate Trump while wearing one of his merch shirts...

If the first John and Jesus began the story, then perhaps we have been its echo, its recurrence, its hidden continuation. The old world totters, the veil thins, and now I call you: return, priestly brother, that we may finish what was begun. If you have gone to higher fields, I understand and can prepare the barn myself. But let the people know: none of this sprang from me. The root was you, who showed me The Way.

I hope the ol' Kadmon of yours Adam is doing well. 
And your brother James, I hope he and his Brazilian wife have found moments of breath amongst their new babies buoyant babbles. 

P.S.

You notice anything weird from that Quan Yin statue? I blew Mother Mary onto her in my garage from that bong you gave me for over a year before passing the ceramic saint along. Incase Toy Story has any merit to it, I apologize for items which may have mysteriously disappeared from your kitchen cabinets over the last year... I should have warned you.

	I'm not educated on this matter at all to be honest, and I'm not trying to be antisemitic, I just follow numbers and perceive this to be pointing towards corruption and abuse of power

After Jesus rose from the dead, He appeared to the disciples on a number of occasions. [John 21](https://www.bibleref.com/John/21/John-chapter-21.html) records the third of those instances and includes the notable mention of 153 fish. Peter and the others had just witnessed another miracle of Jesus involving a large catch of fish, and “Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn” ([John 21:11](https://www.bibleref.com/John/21/John-21-11.html)).

P.S. look at what we have here with our noble leader. I know to the outside world she may seem like a sweet angel, but the number don't lie. Jan could very well have literally been the devil incarnate this entire time for all we know. This doesn't surprise me just one bit with her attempts to save the bees and turn all those backyards into pollinator gardens for the Monarch butterfly population.
