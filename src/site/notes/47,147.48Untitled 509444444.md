Listened to this over 150+ times
nearly everyday
I was meditating to this
on the weeks leading up to different UFO experiences

In research mode,  questioning myself and the topic I was talking about for a second, then saw the 444k in the recommendations n clicked it 
 workflow just shattered
Can't even think anymore
this is personally one of my most profound moments
 I have finally re-connected with [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]] 
This is like 1 trillion dollars (to me)
Although arguably, 
Steve Jobs was an enormous fan of Autobiography of a Yogi,
which is where Babaji was essentially introduced to the Western mind.
So much so, he actually had copies of the book handed out to everyone that attended his funeral. 
Apple is worth 4 trillion today.
(but unfortunately Steve Jobs only owned about .25% at the time of his death)
He owned 15% at one point, which would have made him by far, the richest man in the world. Another source claims 11%, and at that rate he would be neck and neck with Elon, only ~25-30 billion behind.

Apple alone doesn't account for the other sources of income which contributed to Jobs well earned monastery mountain. When Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, he became a member of the company’s board of directors, and their largest shareholder, at 7.4%. Yahoo Finance claims that this was about $4.6billion worth at the time.

This website is making a mistake  because it did not increase by 0.47%
Everything is up to par inside though

Don't believe me? Look at how Babaji left the markets for the weekend that night

( I have been studying the Jewish religion, and am a big fan of it. I do not claim that second gematria result as true, but its there related to the Steve Jobs one, THAT'S IT - I do not follow politics whatsoever, or listen to anyone that talks about politics, and have absolutely no idea what is going on in that sphere. I get brief updates when riding in a vehicle with my brother, but other than that, consider me oblivious. )

This is what I'm about
