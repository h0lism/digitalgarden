I would like to announce that I have finally discovered the root of evil.
Money. 
Right now I have no money. 
0.
That means I have no evil.
I’m perfect. 

You? 
Unless you are some broke loser…
You probably work.
Have a job. 
Figure a way to make ends meet.
To provide for yourself.

This means that you make money.
Or at least have a reservoir of it to live from.
Therefore, you make evil.
Or live out of it.
A little stash of sin.
Pathetic.
Why do you keep doing these things?
Can’t you see? 
Look at what you have become. 
Sick,
vile,
twisted. 

Who makes evil? 
The devil.
Who makes money? 
Not me.
Therefore, I am not the devil. 
They call me a broke chump
but really,
I’m a broke champion.

Who makes no money? 
Jesus. 
He flipped tables at the sight of it.
Found it disgusting.
This is a house of God,
not some materialistic mudslide. 

Hello sinner. 
It’s me.
The chosen one. 
Gods favorite. 

Haven’t you heard?
The road is getting narrow.
The crow is the bird.
It’s time for you to harrow.
Where’s the wheelbarrow? 
I think it’s very peril.
All the way down to the marrow,
you must cleanse yourself, get sterile. 
Stair I’ll climb, up to reach the feral,
It’s all fair, El Diablo singing carol
Let us rise,
Put on your apparel
Garment of light, 
Made of Chrysoberyl (Refractive Index 1.744 – 1.755)
I wonder who's Lewis Carol
There's been big changes occurring at the Cracker Barrel

But after receiving feedback from others...

I am Alexander The Great
The most renowned military leader of all time
a 25 year old
with no car
living off of food stamps 
in his Fathers basement.

In this video, we see renowned coach Owen Cook navigating the glorious terrain of 
Alexandria, Washington DC
He even stumbles upon an asteroid display...

He then proceeds to obliterate, I'm sure at-least one of his viewers ego's out there...

"Someone who's very successful, 
but it's actually taken away their soul,
When you know what you're looking at, 
they look completely ridiculous. 
Like, like, right in their beady little pupils, little bug eyes, they look absolutely ridiculous. 
But they don't know that about themselves. 
So that's the ultimate predator, is the devil himself. 
The ultimate predator, not finding that spiritual side. 
But again, now you start saying to yourself, 
"Oh, should I not learn about business? 
Should I not learn? 
Should I not learn about how the world works? 
No. 
No. 
Because otherwise, 
again, 
what's the alternative? Just sit here and go
"Oh yeah, man. I'm all spiritual and shit. 
This is not just because I'm too lazy to do anything. 
It's cuz I'm fucking spiritual, man." 
Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
Non-dual awareness, baby. Yeah. 
Yeaah.
Yeah. "

Dan Koe,
He got me pretty good too...

I guess I have to figure out some way to provide you guys some value.

The Akashic Records
Halls of Amenti
Perhaps you've heard of it.
Been there.
Done that.
Barely made it out.
But I did.
Through the seasons.
I did this all 
for one 
single.
reason.

You(r money)

If you are interested...
and brave,
perhaps I could show you 
the treacherous road,
no other man
has yet to pave...

Look, I can’t guarantee that anything happens. You aren’t going to wake up tomorrow and all of a sudden come to the fascinating realization that you were Louis Armstrong and begin to play the saxophone at an expert level. In fact, look, what if you were Hitler? Think about it, you may have been a naughty Nazi not seein in Germany, or one of Genghis Khan’s right hand men, the ones who helped him see to the spread of his sea men(boat warfare). There’s a possibility that you were forcing yourself upon women, taking children to early graves, and pillaging entire villages. All this dormant underneath the good vibes at raves. You think you are a good person today, and maybe you are, having lived the life of a literal saint, but that doesn’t change the fact that maybe this goodness is potentially a soul makeover, for one who, without any shame or reservation, was showing ankles in Baghdad 33AD. Now, to balance things, there is a percentage chance that your soul could have a past as Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, even someone like Mother Theresa or Martin Luther King Jr., karmic lottery winners. We are going to be rolling the dice here... do you like to gamble? In efforts to reach towards a new badge of identity, you could accidentally discover that you've spent time eating human beings as part of a cannibalistic cult in some remote region of South America, or tortured puppies and babies with needles and fire. Is the wager worth it? Truth is the highest value... Maybe you took out hundreds of innocent people in the Rwandan Genocide, and spat on graves after defiling their dead bodies. Are you ready to come to terms with these sorts of things and resolve them? Hey, maybe you built orphanages. Perhaps you've spent life after life on a mission to serve others and dedicate yourself to a greater cause. What if you invented some of the early parts of the Bulgarian language? The seesaw. Linguini. Various events are possible on the horizon. If emotions come up, I doubt you’re going to actually get a theater mode type memory replay, maybe, but more so we would see karmic energy being released…how do you think you'd handle it? You’ve already been carrying this baggage around on your souls shoulders, potentially, for lifetimes. You owe it to yourself to at-least see what's inside the briefcase. It could be so, that you have naturally throughout your life had different karmic experiences to resolve these things as-well, but, maybe the road led you here, to the strange wizard in the back of an alley offering you a new life.

If we consider releasing what has been sealed, there is a potential that, through this process, you could ‘transmute’ or ‘alchemize’ negative things from your past(lives), transforming them into spiritual gifts and tapping into the next evolution of your soul. It’s like you are entering prestige mode in Call of Duty. There is a potential that this process may be destabilizing, feeling like you’ve gone from level 55 back down to level 1. At the same time, however, you get a new understanding, a new prestige emblem, and there is the potential for you to unlock.... yourself.

Maybe you can even find your way down a trail which brings you to a direct identity/person. I was able to potentially accomplish this, but there's no way that I can really throw a guarantee here. What you may experience is the emotional and karmic release of these past lives without ever coming into an actual concrete conclusion as to a specific identity you inhabited in a prior life experience. Would that let you down? It may all be energetic. However, through Gematria, and a deep paying attention to the synchronicities which are unfolding in your life, THE NUMBERS MASON, and perhaps a little guidance to help piece the clues together, maybe it’s possible. 

This all taking place in a community, as well, may amplify the energy that we are creating. We could be recruiting the attention and mental focus, life force, of a whole group, enlisting morphogenesis, to make this portal into the ether as powerful as possible. If this is a mission that God is directing, then perhaps the cosmos is ready to support this sort of endeavor on a larger scale. I was the prototype test dummy, and survived the ordeal, and so now, maybe we can run some soul experiments and see what happens. Think of the networking opportunities. Albert Einstein could be in here. Benjamin Franklin may reply to one of your comments on a post that was originally shared by the first Queen of England. What if you developed a spark with the guy that invented electricity, or came into contact with the creator of the carriage, the baby one. The horse one too. Both of them may stand side by side in the garden, right next to you. The possibilities are endless.

I have to warn you though. The guy on Tucker Carlson recently talking about the anti-christ, he claims that this individual may be identified as a "Pharaoh," and he also specifically mentions the word 'starseed' as-well. Anrita Melchizedek, my extraterrestrial expedition guide for the last few years, its all Starseed stuff. The Keys of Enoch. I literally heard it telepathically when this first started occurring, never had an experience like that prior. Bat Kol, as I learned the Rabbis call it.

Anrita in Sanskrit can translate to "untruth," "lying," "false," or  “(that which is) unreal”
Pharoah Caesarion XV, Irmaatenre – "Carrying out the rule of Ra" 
In Hebrew,  רַע (ra) translates to  "bad"

I don't think she is really all that nefarious. There was a time where I started to think that Anrita was a cult leader, perhaps even some sort of a CIA plant. I sent her this wild email breaking down the etymology of her name, the gig is up lady, I'm not going to fall for your deceptions anymore, SATAN WOMAN!!! Anrita was unmoved by the defensive positioning of my minds psychological warfare tactics, in-fact, she has sent me free crystals, kindness, and free masterclasses.

I guess all I feel obligated to say, is that perhaps they already have me, and it's too late. 

Regardless of whether or not you join us 
in our descent
what I argue has become your onus
is to at-least follow the scent
catch a spot by the lotus
where the ground is muddy and bent
what number is the potus?
c'mon, at-least place a tent
watch those who climb down focus
recap their journeys, post-merkava ascent.
see if they are filled with bogus
become troubled and miss rent
you have found the locus
in terms of houses this is the pent
although consider I'm hocus pocus
washed up 
and spent
