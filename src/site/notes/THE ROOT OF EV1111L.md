Have you heard of the Atlas 3i thing?

Atlas 3i is only the (3)rd (i)nterstellar object that we have detected roaming through our solar system. It is currently being monitored by observatories worldwide as it approaches its perihelion (closest point to the Sun) around October 29-30, 2025. No need to fret, it poses absolutely no threat to Earth. This comet was discovered by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025, at a distance of 420 million miles from the Sun(blaze it). However, there were earlier observations. In Astrology there is something called "precovery," short for¬†pre-discovery recovery. This is when something is discovered, and then they go back and observe prior 'footage', running back the tapes, catching its presence before they knew about it. The earliest precovery date for this Atlas 3i comet goes back to around May 7th, which was the time that everything in [[ìãπ The End ìÜô\|ìãπ The End ìÜô]] began to get going, 55 days before it's official discovery.

Rev 5:5
	Then one of the elders said to me, ‚ÄúDo not weep! See, the Lion¬†of the tribe of Judah,¬†the Root of David,¬†has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.‚Äù

Something interesting I discovered about this, was that when the Atlas 3i was in conjunction with the sun on 10/21, there was a powerful CME blast from the sun. Perhaps this is just basic science

Just a day later, on October 22, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) - the United Nations-endorsed organization that works with NASA‚Äôs Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) - officially added 3I/ATLAS to its Comet Astrometry Campaign. A ‚Äúdefense alarm‚Äù in the doomsday sense, like a lot of articles seem to try and imply, is not what has been set off. More-so, this is a global observational drill, the first ever involving an interstellar object. Telescopes from Hawai‚Äòi to the Canary Islands are now syncing their sights to refine trajectory data and study what NASA calls an ‚Äúunusually behaving interstellar visitor.‚Äù

Harvard scientist Dr. Avi Loeb has been doing research on this thing, and he seems to be hinting at the fact that it may be some sort of extraterrestrial anomaly. They have noticed that there is an unusual composition of nickel tetracarbonyl, and very little iron, what they only find in industrial produced nickel-alloys. He also points out that its trajectory is aligned almost perfectly (within 5 degrees) with the ecliptic plane, the flat plane on which the planets of our solar system orbit. He calls this a "one-in-500 coincidence."

![Pasted image 20251023025320.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251023025320.png)

Loeb has even gone so far as to draw a connection between 3I/ATLAS and an unexplained space message that was received in 1977. The legendary WOW! signal was captured by the Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope for 72 seconds, in a burst that was so unusual, it prompted astronomer Jerry Ehman to write 'WOW!' on the telescope's readout. In one of Loeb's searches for understanding, he found that on August 12, 1977, just a few days before the WOW! signal was detected, 3I/ATLAS was in a part of the sky very close to where the signal came from. The chances of two random points in the sky being this close are only about 0.6 percent, which makes you wonder. 1977 lets see that was... 48 years ago. (In their defense, I know they were a little early, my friends are from a different timezone). On this day as-well, the space shuttle Enterprise made its first free-flight test. The shuttle detached from its carrier aircraft, a modified 747, and then flew for 321 seconds, before landing down onto Rogers Dry Lake.

We are still waiting for NASA to release the highest resolution image we have of this thing, obtained on October 2nd, by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The government shutdown probably has something to do with it... but I mean, can't someone sneak in to mission command with a thumb-drive? There was something strange about this whole comet situation. It had an 'anti-tail', with emissions that were shooting towards the sun, rather than away from it. What is happening here? In September it then shifted, and redirected back towards what you would have expected to see in the first place. The anti-tail that was pointed towards the sun, changed directions and is now going away from the sun - and they have no idea why. Well, there may be some scientific ideas to give us reason, but I will not look for, and don't want to read them. Avi has theorized that the maneuver is a telltale sign of a spacecraft that is using the gravity of a large star to change its speed and course. Why would they be taking a stroll through our neck of the woods you might wonder,

"Given the minimum diameter of 5 kilometers for 3I/ATLAS (as derived here), the solar illumination at perihelion would deliver more than 33 gigawatts of power to its surface, namely at least a third of the total power generated by 94 operating commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. ‚Äî the largest producer of nuclear power in the world."

This 'comet' is supposed to be over 3 miles long, at-least a 1000 times larger than the previous interstellar objects they have seen. To quote from NASA's website, "Observations as of Aug. 20, 2025, indicate that the upper limit on its diameter is 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers), though it could be as small as 1,444 feet (440 meters) across." Why is this giant all of a sudden being delivered to our inner solar system, when we have only seen smaller ones before? Just flying through...

You? 
Unless you are some broke loser‚Ä¶

This means that you make money.

Therefore, you make evil.
Or live out of it.
A little stash of sin.
I couldn't think of anything more pathetic.
Why do you keep doing these things?
Can‚Äôt you see? 
Look at what you have become. 
Sick,

Who makes evil? 
The devil.
Who makes money? 
Not me.
Therefore, I am not the devil. 
They call me a broke chump

I‚Äôm a broke champion.

Who makes no money? 
Jesus. 
He flipped tables at the sight of it.
Found it disgusting.
This is a house of God,

Hello sinner. 
It‚Äôs me.

Haven‚Äôt you heard?
The road is getting narrow.
The crow is the bird.
It‚Äôs time for you to harrow.
Where‚Äôs the wheelbarrow?

Look, I can‚Äôt guarantee that anything happens. You aren‚Äôt going to wake up tomorrow and all of a sudden come to the fascinating realization that you were Louis Armstrong and begin to play the saxophone at an expert level. In fact, look, what if you were Hitler? Think about it, you may have been a naughty Nazi not seein in Germany, or one of Genghis Khan‚Äôs right hand men, the ones who helped him see to the spread of his sea men(boat warfare). There‚Äôs a possibility that you were forcing yourself upon women, taking children to early graves, all this dormant underneath the good vibes at raves. Pillaging entire villages, burning them to the ground. You think you are a good person today, and maybe you're sound. You could have lived the life of a literal saint, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that maybe this goodness is potentially a soul makeover, just paint. Without any shame or reservation, showing ankles around the town of Baghdad, you sinner. Now, to balance things, there is a percentage chance that your soul could have a past as Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, even someone like Mother Theresa or Martin Luther King Jr., karmic lottery winners. We are going to be rolling the dice here... do you like to gamble? In efforts to reach towards a new badge of identity, you could accidentally discover that you've spent time eating human beings as part of a cannibalistic cult in some remote region of South America, or tortured puppies and babies with needles, fire, and anvil. Is the wager worth it? Truth is the highest value... Are you ready to come to terms with these sorts of things and resolve them? Hey, maybe you built orphanages. Perhaps you've spent life after life on a mission to serve others and dedicate yourself to a greater cause. What if you invented some of the early parts of the Bulgarian language? The seesaw. Canned chili. Various events are possible on the horizon. You‚Äôve already been carrying this baggage around on your souls shoulders, potentially, for lifetimes. You owe it to yourself to at-least see what's inside the briefcase. Let go of some of that burden. Release buried patterns that have quietly run your life for years. It could be so, that you have naturally throughout your life had different karmic experiences to resolve these things as-well, sure, but, maybe the road led you here, to the strange wizard in the back of an alley offering you a new life.

Let me give you a little more context, as to the specific work we will be doing here. 

What I will relay here are notes from Anrita Melchizedek's work which has a lot of knowledge from the Atlantean Thoth's perspective. I am not claiming any of this to be true or not, and you should use your own discernment. Dr. Justin Sledge, for example, doesn't promote the new age Emerald Tablets of Thoth the Atlantean. I discovered this text early in my awakening journey and found it impactful, an activation of sorts, despite the fact it is not technically legitimate. The real Emerald Tablet of Hermes is something that I believe I had found my way to beforehand, and through following that same trail, I was brought to this other piece of literature. Not that it was necessarily a trail of pure 100% truth and accuracy. 

The original outlines the process of transformation through alchemical means, both physically (transforming base metals into gold) and spiritually (the evolution of the soul). You've probably heard it before, it's famous for phrases such as "As above, so below" and "The All is One." Hermes Trismegistus, who ended up being the credited author of the Emerald Tablet, could be argued as a result of the cultural blending that occurred due to Alexander's empire. Hermeticism, which combines different elements from Greek, Egyptian, and other philosophical traditions, flourished in Alexandria. The Greek Hermes, who is the messenger god and patron of boundaries and transitions(which seems to have similarities to Enoch/Metatron), was then synthesized with Thoth, the Egyptian deity of writing, knowledge, and magic. There are some interesting rumors that ended up circulating about Alexander the Great being the one to discover the Emerald Tablets in the tomb of Hermes, but at the end of the day, these probably don't have much merit to them. Unfortunately, it has been lost for the last 1,200 years or so, surviving only through the remnants of written down copies.

It really is quite a short read. You could have finished it thrice by the time you were done with that last paragraph of my rambling there. The wise say very little. One translation from Issac Newton.
	https://sacred-texts.com/alc/emerald.htm

The teachings of the Melchizedek are supposed to be a symposium of all the universal eclectic teaching that unveil, step by step(from a higher perspective it would arguably be simultaneously), throughout the various Golden Age timelines which we have had - Atlantis and ancient Egypt to name a few. Timelines which we have achieved self-mastery, we are drawing upon these teachings. An understanding of sacred geometry, various levels of initiations, the rays of creation, the kabbala, and ultimately, the ability to transform at a cellular level to the crystalline consciousness. 

When it comes to talking ascension, the first part of the ordeal is spiritual. This is where we are clearing density, expanding our consciousness, and embodying our higher selves. The second part of our ascension process is the physical part of the operation, where we essentially become immortal. Every cell in the body becomes crystalline in consciousness, the Christ consciousness field of vibrating stargates and portals from within - immortal chromosomes. It takes us out from the spiral of life and death into the ability to choose, whether we will experience life and death. Right now, we have the ability to know in this golden age, once more, that divine blueprint. Through the grids of light in and around the earth, and through the collective consciousness of enough awakened souls to hold that flame of light individually through their own bodies, light bodies, we can experience this physical ascension process where we all become Christ-like beings. 

The Halls of Amenti used to exist physically in Atlantis. They were overlighted by a being of light known as master Horlet. During the initial stage of Atlantis there were 12 main islands/tribes, and there were 2 primary emerging forward evolutionary paths. The high priestess roles, and the scientist. Both of these would take us into quantum fields of cosmic Christ consciousness. Only through the story of Thoth the Atlantean from the emerald tablets, do we have an understanding of how that time-space continuum, The Halls of Amenti, was created. Essentially it was a zero point field of consciousness holding all dimensions within it. 

In 2001 Anrita took a group to Egypt and and did a bunch of amazing work with the "cords of the sphinx," unveiling a lot of higher mind/mystery school teachings, allowing for them to experience the Halls of Amenti energetically. What has shifted since then, is that we are now in this timeline where we can shift out of the cycle of life and death. We can choose to go before, what we call "The Lord of Death," and move out/expand beyond the cycle of life and death, into the understanding that we are experiencing our physical ascension, or 'choosing' it in this lifetime.
The only thing we have to remember/recognize is that all of this is based on our level of density; the false beliefs, judgements, victim-persecutor consciousness/thoughts/feelings/patterns, that are held in the body and need to be cleared. If we cannot raise our vibration/frequency to be able to fully embody all of our higher selves, there isn't a possibility for us to physically ascend.  

This is a timeline where we are once more, experiencing many of the beautiful frequencies and energies of the golden age assisting us to move through this spiritual ascension, and then into the physical ascension. While we are expanding our consciousness and releasing the density and karmic timelines from the lower dimensions, what we are also doing is moving from the carbon based frequency within, to silica, to crystalline consciousness. It is a very real process whereby every subatomic particle within the body becomes light. This is something that we are able to do in this lifetime once more. Hallelujah. We have to recognize that a large part of this work is on the body, coming into the templates of the body that are activating. All is held within the body, it keeps the score as we experience New Earth. We are going to be shifting up through to soul consciousness, and into the quantum field of receiving. A lot of the frequencies and energies outside of our own, what you could say holographic field/universe, will be coming in, and that is how we are coming together as vibrating portals/stargates of divine love. However, what is occurring for many of us is that.... there are the timelines of Atlantis in which we experienced a fall, what you could call a 'general fall of consciousness.' What so happens to be the case, is that a lot of those pockets of density experienced within the body.... they are related to these Atlantean timelines. 

A lot of us are experiencing, what may show up as fear.
A perceived sense of lack of trust,
that we are not going to ascend in this lifetime again. 
This is because at the very end we had to hide,
and we think we have to hide again,
take everything back under, 
in a way, 
and so,
what we might see, 
is a self sabotage pattern come up.

As we escalate our light and clear the fields/pockets of density within,
we get a point where that disillusionment might settle in. 
A lot of fear is being released,
or the victim persecutor consciousness, 
a perceived sense of separation...

...a lot of these things are coming up from timelines of Atlantis.

We need to be able to clear those timelines, and we are going to do so - by entering into the Halls of Amenti, and accessing the golden book of Akasha. Remember, this is a zero point field which holds all dimensions of consciousness. One of the easiest ways to access the book of Akasha, and to changes its records, is from within the Halls of Amenti. The only problem is getting there, and that's where I come in. By moving through the primary timelines within Atlantis, where we saw a fall of consciousness, experiencing what that fear is for us - what that separation is for us - what that sense of victim persecutor consciousness is, or abuse/misuse of power is, we are able to truly clear those timelines once and for all. Part of what we will do, is merge with our Atlantean higher selves, and work with what we call an Ankh break. What this is, is a beautiful remembrance of the immortal essence of ourselves. After that occurs, what activates is the kundalini. As-well, what comes online, are many of the frequencies within the body that can bring through a deepening level of the Christed light within, that which we call our beautiful soul light - what is really our purity and innocence. In Atlantis Golden Ages, we were able to physically access the Halls of Amenti, because our frequency matched those vibrational pockets. Boy, times sure have changed. 

Now you are here. 

If we consider releasing what has been sealed, there is a potential that, through this process, you could ‚Äòtransmute‚Äô or ‚Äòalchemize‚Äô negative things from your past(lives), transforming them into spiritual gifts and tapping into the next evolution of your soul. It‚Äôs like you are entering prestige mode in Call of Duty. There is a potential that this process may be destabilizing, feeling like you‚Äôve gone from level 55 back down to level 1. At the same time, however, you get a new understanding, a new prestige emblem, and there is the potential for you to unlock.... yourself. 

![a9dbje (1).gif](/img/user/images/a9dbje%20(1).gif)

Maybe you can even find your way down a trail which brings you to a direct identity/person. I was able to potentially accomplish this, but there's no way that I can really throw a guarantee here. What you may experience is the emotional and karmic release of these past lives without ever coming into an actual concrete conclusion as to a specific identity you inhabited in a prior life experience. Would that let you down? It may all be energetic. However, through Gematria, and a deep paying attention to the synchronicities which are unfolding in your life, "The numbers Mason," and perhaps a little guidance to help piece the clues together, maybe it‚Äôs possible. This all taking place as a community, as well, may amplify the energy that we are creating. We could be recruiting the attention and mental focus, life force, of a whole group, enlisting morphogenesis, to make this portal into the ether as powerful as possible. If this is a mission that God is directing, organizing celestial bodies towards the sun to amplify our mission, then perhaps the cosmos is ready to support this sort of endeavor on a larger scale. I was the prototype test dummy and survived the ordeal, so now, maybe we can run some soul experiments and see what happens. Think of the networking opportunities. Albert Einstein could be in here. Benjamin Franklin may reply to one of your comments on a post that was originally shared by the first Queen of England. What if you developed a spark with the guy that invented electricity, or came into contact with the creator of the carriage, the baby one. The horse one too. Both of them may stand side by side in the garden, right next to you. The possibilities are endless. 

![lotr1.jpg](/img/user/images/lotr1.jpg)

I do find it necessary, though, to warn you. The guy on Tucker Carlson recently talking about the Anti-Christ, he claims that this individual may be identified as a "Pharaoh," and he also specifically mentions the word 'Starseed' as-well. Anrita Melchizedek, my extraterrestrial expedition guide for the last few years, it is all Starseed stuff. The Keys of Enoch too. I heard it telepathically when this first started occurring, never had an experience like that prior. Bat Kol, as I learned the Rabbis call it. 

Anrita in Sanskrit can translate to "untruth," "lying," "false," or ¬†‚Äú(that which is) unreal‚Äù
Pharoah Caesarion XV, Irmaatenre ‚Äì "Carrying out the rule of Ra" 
In Hebrew,  ◊®÷∑◊¢ (ra) translates to¬† "bad"

I don't believe she is really all that nefarious, but this isn't without my own investigations. There was a time where I started to think that Anrita was a cult leader, perhaps even some sort of a CIA plant. I sent her this wild email breaking down the etymology of her name, the gig is up lady, I'm not going to fall for your deceptions anymore, SATAN WOMAN! Anrita was unmoved by the defensive positioning of my minds psychological warfare tactics, in-fact, she has sent me free crystals, masterclasses, and kindness in response.

I guess all I feel obligated to say, is that perhaps they already have me, and it's too late. 

Regardless of whether or not you join us 
in our descent
what I argue has become your onus

catch a spot by the lotus
where the ground is muddy and bent
what number is the potus?
c'mon, at-least place a tent
watch those who climb down focus
recap their journeys, post-merkava ascent.
see if they are filled with bogus
become troubled and miss rent
you have found the locus
in terms of houses, this is the pent
although consider I'm hocus pocus
washed up 
and spent

This Halloween Eve (10-30), 
near the time of Samhain,
an ancient Celtic festival marking the end of the harvest season,
and the beginning of winter,
when the veils between the two worlds is its thinnest...
and.... 
Atlas 3i is closest to the sun, 
perhaps extraterrestrial friends of mine,
assisting us,

The Garden opens. 

Featuring a 60 minute
Akashic Records Access

Remember who you were before the world told you who to be.
Finally see the invisible forces that have been steering your choices.
Turn your past life wounds into present-life strength.

The gates are open for 11 days. 
After that, only the committed remain.
