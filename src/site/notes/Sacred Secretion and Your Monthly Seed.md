Revelation 22:2 ( KJV)

> 2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

The original Greek of Revelation 22.2 

> καὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐντεῦθεν καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ξύλον ζωῆς ποιοῦν καρποὺς δώδεκα, κατὰ μῆνα ἕκαστον ἀποδιδοῦν τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ


it could be 12 fruits spread over a year; or it could be 12 fruits as an unqualified total.

The next phrase is κατὰ μῆνα ἕκαστον ἀποδιδοῦν τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ, “according to each month giving its fruit.” When we put the two phrases together the likely picture is of a twelve month cycle. The fruit has the sense of harvest, and the tree will produce a harvest every month, twelve harvests a year.


Pornography is one of the ways the demonic presence lives in our world, incest as the fastest rising category shows us how this force operates and attempts to corrupt even the family unit, the most sacred of unions. 

Masturbation in satanic circles is even referred to as child sacrifice.

"One of the fastest ways to destroy the stability of families and societies is through promiscuity, mental and/or physical, and the best way to maintain stability is through self control. Stability for society is based on morality. Morality is based on harnessing and controlling sexuality."
