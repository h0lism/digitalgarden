I went ahead and scavenged the Keys of Enoch to find everything I possibly could on Starseeds. 

KEY 104 (19 - 20)
	19 We will then see that our human creation is part of the greater creation which seeds its life codes by crystal invagination into cycles of star field creation. 
	20 Before this can take place the human evolution must be educated to understand the presence of the Merkabah which is the key to engendering a whole new star seed creation.

Key 104 (27)
27 Enoch explained to me that as the universe expands through the celestial architecture, programmed intelligence takes the assignment of coming out of the higher networks of intelligence to work with the intelligence of a given Population I Life System. 
28 Whereupon, he showed me a picture of how the center of our galaxy unfolds through the opening up of spiral arms; as star fields cool off with their earth systems in between, the Higher Evolution is able to program intelligence onto these new-born planets. 
29 Again, as the galaxy of Population I Life Systems is expanded, sun systems cool off, the right chemical environment forms, and the star seed is planted. 
30 When the evolution reaches the next initiation point of its wavelength of light, new wavelengths of light can be projected through triangular coordinates; through this process the brotherhoods of higher Population II Life Systems continually perfect the programs of all interplanetary creations on this side. 
31 In order to put man into the building blocks of pyramidal geometries, triangular coordinates and Pyramids of Light, we have this key in the Consciousness of Light: centropy is the electrification of matter (specifically in a material function), Light being the highest amplification of centropy.

Key 106 (6)

6 Through the energy of Ze the Lords of Light transform the world of negative mass into Magnetic tunnels where particles are cycled and recycled, allowing some forms of star seed evolution to unfold into given forms of light continuity. Thus, physical life proceeds out of mass-evolution.


key 107

23 The Pyramid of Light, the Throne Energy of Light, gives the entrance to the Throne control of star evolution. The Pyramid of Light commissions the Lords of Light to build physical pyramids on the lower planispheres and to code within them the central keystone of knowledge to explain how Metatronic physics can enable Man, once he has brought together all of the spiritual languages and scientific gifts, to enter into the presence of the Throne. 24 In the teachings of the Zohar, it is the function of the Ophanim and the Cherubim to train the various galactic councils in the language of Light, so that those councils can synchronize the time cells of their administration with the right knowledge within the turning of the Wheel of the Law. 25 This turning of the Wheel of the Law dispenses the proper knowledge for soul evolution. By speeding up the Wheel of the Law the material plane can reach a state of non-evolving perfection, for it is the Father's Will to grant freedom of the spirit and everlasting Spiritlife to everyone who accepts His Kingdom.
26 Even the fallen angels, at the end of a great cycle will be freed from the lower heavens if they accept the Father's Love with complete obedience to His Word. 27 The scripture of the Melchizedek Brotherhood tells us that there are many Brotherhoods of Ophanim, the messengers of YHWH, working with interplanetary sciences and consciousness evolution. 28 In all there are seventy brotherhoods of Light working within our universe, all having within them the ability to understand any type of spiritual language or any type of spiritual knowledge which is shown to them from the Hierarchy of Light. 29 Among these, the Brotherhood of Melchizedek works with the consciousness awakening and reprogramming of light in the life cycle of the planets. 30 The Brotherhood or the Order of Enoch works with the scientific teachings and keys necessary to evolve star seed evolution and to build Pyramids and pyramidal grids of light upon the planets.

109  42-47

42 We see in this picture the necessity of a given planetary mind system, or kingdom of intelligence, to separate from its sun system before the sun system destroys that planetary creation or that planetary field of intelligence. 43 Enoch told me that stars are not the only source of elements beyond atomic structure. 44 Stellar radiations and cosmic ray bombardment produce chemical and physical reactions. These radiations may affect members of the planetary family by generating complex organic molecules from simple inorganic substances, giving rise to a vast variety of intelligences. 45 In cases where the earth type of life has evolved, radiation is necessary for the process of photosynthesis, from which all higher forms of physical life derive their energy. 46 It is at this point that the life intelligence must decide if it has the ability to go through cubic life space, to become identified with a higher evolutionary star seed intelligence in a neighboring star system and join in co-participation as a new member of a galactic family. 47 If it does this it proceeds from its parent star, to a secondary star, and into a pluralistic form of galactic creation of many suns; if it does not mutate into multidimensional star directions, it is devoured and destroyed.

109

101 The Lords of Light on Archturus, for example, tell us that they supervise all evolving intelligence within sun systems on this end of our galaxy. Their star probes are projected into our sun system in a desire to re-evolve our sun's chemical environment which would allow our star seed to connect with greater suns, in greater evolutions. 102 And in order for Man to enter this greater evolution and have his image recreated as the Adam Kadmon, he must first go through the Night of Destruction, the Night of Despair. He must go through the negative cubic star energy spaces that surround his organic kingdom. 103 If he is to recognize the key to the anti-universe from the teachings of Enoch, Man must first see the multiple evolutionary phases that he is currently going through to understand the complexity of other star kingdoms of benevolent and aggressive intelligence with respect to the Earth's planetary creation. 104 Secondly, Man must see the earth's kingdoms with respect to the limitations of its singular sun system, which is rapidly approaching a point of critical mass factors and neutral mass factors manifested in solar storms which can cause tremendous geophysical change on this planet, even to the point of massive destruction by released torque factors.

105 Thirdly, Man must see the mappings of the human evolution within multiple star charts which were left on this planet for the human mind to understand. 106 These ancient star charts speak of the Lords of Light who come from multiple star systems into this kingdom of matter. 107 These star documents teach Man that he can acquire the consciousness propensity to go beyond the orbital phases of his singular sun system. 108 They tell of how star seed evolutions remake themselves once they are beyond the planetary and the singular patterns of star evolution. 109 Therefore, arise, 0 Man of the earth and shed forth Light, for a new heavens and a new earth are being created; and upon you the very glory of Jehovah-YaHWeH shines forth.

110

31 This key speaks of the language system of Light given by the Higher Evolution to the star seed on this planet to enable this seed to go through many galactic formations and transformations. 32 And through this manifestation of the Word, projected thought-forms from the higher galactic kingdoms of creations materialize not only one set, but multiple sets of evolutionary kingdoms of creation. 33 Therefore, there are multiple patterns of knowledge which create kingdoms in matter by virtue of being thought-forms projected beyond the kingdom of creation. These thought-forms are constantly being reseeded through language patterns throughout the immediate universe, materializing multiple energy forms.

36 The Pistis Sophia, conceived in Hebrew thought-patterns rendered into Greek and Coptic, is one of the great Gospels, for it is a true witness of the mysteries of the language Jesus used to call down his higher Body of Light in the presence of his initiated disciples. It shows how Jesus is the synthesis of the thirty-two chemical building blocks of intelligence within the Mystery of the Logos seen as the Lak Boymer, the Pillar of Light which calls down the Christ Body of Light through the thirty-third degree to inhabit the Jesus Body.

44 When you use EgyptianHebrew-Sanskrit-Tibetan-Chinese words to prime the thought vibrations to flow into your third eye area, the languages will open channels of crystalline vibration within you so that your body can work directly with the Higher Intelligence through telethoiight communication.

114

17 The key of Enoch is saying that we will go through "negative entropy. " Simultaneously, we will be taken by Higher Intelligence and moved into a new field of star seed evolution. 18 This will take place by the "Pillar of Light" which realigns our life space as we proceed into the next ordering of evolution. We will go towards the ultraviolet threshold through a Pillar of Light which penetrates all protective (layered) atmospheres and absorbs radiation so that light is benign! 19 Man is part of a larger crystalline vehicle which goes through a superimposed scale not in the "original physical matrix." 20 Thus, the regenerating program is implanted within our core lattice of crystal encompassing the entire planetary field of human experience while the other diminishing activities, not protected by the Pillar of Light, are allowed to completely dissipate. 21 However, this complete realignment of the larger vehicle can take place only when the end of the cycle occurs. This must come at the appropriate time lest complete degeneration of the consciousness takes place. 22 This transition into new astronomical and consciousness spaces is known as a space-time overlap.

49 Enochian Keys?

Key 108

43 Through the expression: Quanta Deck Our Consc~ousness Quanta Deck 5chema 49 many e m Hyper Spacc ern Hyper-Space 'em = electrurnagner~c forty-nine transitional states of consciousness are used to teach man how his consciousness options can be Integrated with other consciousness time zones in space-time production. By boundary identity of exact opposites, the f~ssion of a
quantum state and the fusion of fragments back to a quantum, mass can be generated into new perception quantum and man into a new operational entity. 44 Enoch told me that a blue white solar spectrum will be placed over our solar system by the Brotherhood of Light so as to prevent our sun from going through star collapse while the specie is reprogrammed to go from a thirddimensional field of crystal to a fifth-dimensional field of crystal as part of the plan of the Higher Evolution. At that time some spiritual beings who have been transfigured by the higher Light will go into the next threshold of being and become multidimensional intelligence. 45 Do give ear to this and know that God's Light scatters the sun's mass as the magnetic bonds of the constellations are loosened. 46 Know the lightnings sent to the extremities of the earth as a seal, all you who love God. He will set his statutes and Councils of the Heavens before earth. 47 Man will see that the boundary lines of intelligence are not defined according to our sun's system; instead, the boundary lines of intelligence bring their own star energies with them to blossom anew wherever the star seed is passed. 48 In the overall creation, soul advancement can proceed to these new star universes blossoming anew only if the soul has cultivated the energy to go on. The insufficient psyche without soul development, however, is not destroyed - but as a drop fallen into a vast ocean of Light is returned to new primeval eons where the more painful task of meta-material creation must begin anew in its own way. 49 Enoch explained that God's plan has no end; even throughout our local universe life continues to recreate itself. "'Man is doomed to perfection." And when you realize this, you will understand why the Father's House has Many Mansions. Amen.

201

35 In our local universe, the Mid-Way stations exemplify a living Son of Light in the image of the higher creation, just as Orion bears the image of the Creator Gods. 36 Thus, the Mid-Way stations prepare the gathering of the seed into the star seed, as it is remade and re-evolved according to the KEY 201 3 6 - 38 star knowledge which emanates from the greater universe - Orion. 37 These Mid-Way stations insure the evenness of transition in the higher heavens while preparing Man for the great Day of deliverance - Yom Or - into a new radiance of Light. 38 And these are the things that are sealed up which God reveals only to those who have passed through the thresholds of living fire to behold the Throne of His Majesty.

204

1 The *'Sons of Lighti ' project the geometries of creation into fourth-dimensional space in order to code spiritual mankind into the fifth dimension, the next larger membrane of universes. The revealing of the codes of Light extend through telethought comunication which is produced by the modulation of gravitational waves. The gravitational waves carry the codlngs of Light intelligence from the larger membrane of universes. 2 You as "a believer" can receive modulated gravitational wave factors that are sent from a Higher Evolutionary Master intelligence of Light. This transmission of knowledge contains codes of Light that give you the realization of God's purpose and recognition of where we are in relation to the large^ evolving universe. 3 This knowledge comes both as a Light force and as a Love force. This is expressed through God's Infinite Mind as Eh~jel? Asher Ehyeh, I AM that I AM, which gives teaching and understanding to our creation through the Hierarchy for the remaking of our evolving specie within cellular time. 4 We exist only within our consciousness time cell until that point where we work directly with the Hierarchy commissioned by the Father to recapitulate the program of Alpha and Omega. 5 Our time and space are the dimensions of time cell consciousness ordered by the greater star seed image. The image is given by the Higher Intelligence as the configuration for connecting the spatial vibrations of the first chakra to the seventh, eighth, and ninth chakras of the Higher Evolutionary Light. 6 The movement towards energy embodiment of the fifth dimension begins with a mutual programming created by projected energy codes creating an eighth and ninth chakra vibratory level. When this takes place, the first and second chakra influences dominating organic three-dimensionality are changed. The human system acquires additional eighth and ninth chakra energy fields which are necessary to receive and send geometries of the Living Light.

206

46 But until we utilize the language codes of Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, we will not recognize that all of these language patterns are triangular coordinates of the Higher Mind centering its knowledge within the human force field. Yet, when we are fused with the Christ, we will recognize that infinite intelligence goes beyond the consciousness of the lower worlds. 47 For this reason, the Torah Or absorbs the fallen galactic realms of consciousness and fuses the misdirected Light into the Light of God. This enables Man to move from zero point evolution to light technology into star seed creation beyond the negative spiral of the galactic tree of this light zone. 48 And when we work directly with the Higher Evolution, we will understand how the Book of Genesis gives four different cosmologies of creation. 49 The first is that of the creation of the illuminaries and the expanse of the many heavens; the second is the creation of our galaxy in the expanse of our heavens; the third is the creation of our greater luminary, i.e., the creation of our solar system; and the fourth, the cycle of Man upon the planet in the image of the Adam Kadmon who could speak with the Infinite Mind and understand the "trees of life" as being the higher Mansion worlds.

209 - 2

2 The Keys of Enoch are manifested between the First Adam Kadmon and the Last Adam Kadmon. In the creation of the thrones and dominions of intelligent genesis and regenesis, the first body of Light consciousness which was used to create the program of star seed materialization is also the same type of Light body used to call forth a new life program at the end of the karmic cycle.

217

18 Thus speaketh the Sons of Light, the Brotherhood of All worlds and Ages of Light, who reside in the midst of Melchizedek and who say unto you, prepare for the New Communion which will open the Earth in the next thirty years, for it shall be the time of visitation and the time of transfiguration. 19 Merkabah speaks and Merkabah goes. Follow 0 Children, the road to Zion, and let Jerusalem be inhabited in Peace and in Holiness from this time forth unto all time forever. 20 The Seraphim tell us, "Rejoice Children of Uprighteousness and Light, the crystalline fields of Light upon the door posts of your body temple have been activated, for you are part of the greater star seed. 21 And the name of this temple within you, which shall not receive the angel of death, but the angel of Light, is called Amen. The "Amen" is identified with the People of God, whether they are at On, Memphis, Beersheba, Bethlehem, Megiddo, or the basin of the Great Salt Lake. All of these faithful communities will rejoice because there the Light has already been centered in the crystalline fields beneath these cities.

 83 In essence, the Book of Genesis explains our Adamic star seed creation in relationship to our "tree of life" within the many mansion worlds of the heavens. 84 It tells of how the Adamic Race was projected on the Seventh Ray from the divine template in the midst of the garden of creation to an outer arm of our galactic Sea of Crystal. However, the Adamic projection was intercepted and limited by fallen angelics. 85 Yet the work of the higher I AM presence was retained by the Adamic seed because the corresponding Overself did not fall, but remained in conjunction with the divine image and similitude. Out of this divine conjunction the Office of the Christ was able to appear on the planet. 86 The divine I AM Overself did not fall because it was not localized within any one particular recorder cell but had the collective image-making capacity working with the Elohim. 87 Unlike the other pre-Adamic creations which lost their spiritual-genetic biostratus, the Overself of the Adamic creation retained the coupling between the seven light shells of the Divine I AM and the extended seven light shells of its physical world so as to continually code a divine I AM presence into the chemical seed of creation, as the extended Divine Seed.


372 

118 The Divine Mind continually projects into consciousness being and plants the divine seeds, or the star seeds, to evolve intelligence of newborn planetary systems, out on the edge of the Sea of Crystal. 119 When Man understands this, then, he will understand that on the edge of our galaxy, we are like the finger cells and toe cells as a host network for the Hosts of the Heavens who work with all forms of linear and non -linear evolution serving the Face of the Loving Father. 120 TO this end of glorifying the Light, that we might advance as the living garment of the Father, we have taken on the wings of our galaxy like the outstretched wings of an eagle, and we have pledged ourselves to the work of YHWH who, through the recorder cell of the Living Light, is continually redeeming creation from the bonds of temporal death through His universal language of divine, sacred Names. 121 Who can deny the revelations of God and say that there are no revelations, no prophecies, no gifts, no healings, no speaking in tongues, and the interpretation of tongues. 122 Who can deny the Eye of the "Eternal Transparency" which sees within life, the creative work of the Elohim and their merging of image space with image space, so that man is set free to proceed into the Living Light. 123 This Light is the Living Love which outshines all darkness, so that darkness can never put out the WORD, the Light code in the midst of our "tree of life" as the Living Light.
