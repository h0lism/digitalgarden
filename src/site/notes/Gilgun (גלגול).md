**"Shaar HaGilgulim"** (The Gate of Reincarnations)

> A king had a vineyard which he had planted. When he saw that the wine was not good, he uprooted it and planted it again. He did this several times. They asked him, "How long will you continue to do this?" He replied, "Until it produces good wine."
	**Sefer HaBahir** (Book of Brilliance)

Turns out there was some guy named Rabbi [[Shani\|Shani]] that talked about reincarnation. I don't think this guy is really all that special, he seems like your average ideological Rabbi, but found his name and this particular subject matter interesting.

"This significant phenomenon of reincarnation can be invoked to resolve numerous questions and apparent contradictions concerning issues of faith, reward and punishment, suffering of the righteous, and contentment of the wicked."

What I found interesting is that, this strange Rabbi Shani, in one of the only works of his I was able to find, seems to mention a [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]]. I'm not sure that he is referencing the same one that I have interest in, but I found it funny. There was some evil guru in America teaching wicked philosophy, so he told this woman to go back and recite the Psalms in the crowd while he was teaching. The first time he began to get upset and kicked her out. The second time, he dropped dead. Putting a bad wrap on Babaji and the name Shani, I can't believe this slander...

Looking at related gematria, I mistook Santorini for having a 555 with the 714 and 119 and then began to look it up "Santorini alexa" to see if there was anything related to Alexander, at which point, Google began to recommend "Alexandria" to finish the prompt

Turns out that it is the name of a Greek Restaurant in Alexandria, with 323(the year Great dies) reviews and 4.7 overall rating. This is just an example of the kinds of weird very subtle synchronicities which turn up in this space, initial mistakes oftentimes turn into some sort of weird path to truth
