The first instance we see of the Nine is within Egypt’s Ennead.

This then translated to 

The Canaanite pantheon, with the divine council of El.

Understanding the progression of the religion, we then see that Yahweh is essentially an absorption of El from the Canaanite religion, and what billions eventually came to worship as the ultimate one true monotheistic God.

The divine council of Yahweh is an assembly of divine, spiritual beings over which Yahweh, the one true God, presides. These beings participate in making decisions with Yahweh, execute these decisions in creation, and rule over creation on Yahweh’s behalf.





Psalm 82:1
God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:

Zeus's council of nine

The Nine Choirs of Angels

The Ennead from the Egyptian religion (nine deities)

Navanatha Sampradaya

The Council of Nine is ultimately one being with nine faces. The Nine are One. One aspect might take an individual core personality and break it down into 9 distinct qualities of that individual personality.

RA: I am Ra. The Council of Nine has been retained in semi-undistorted form by two main sources, that known in your naming, as Mark and that known in your naming as Henry (Mark Probert and Henry Puharich). In one case, the channel became the scribe. In the other, the channel was not the scribe. However, without the aid of the scribe, the energy would not have come to the channel.  -- [Ra](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?session_id=7)

[7.9](https://www.lawofone.info/s/7#9) **Questioner:** I have a question here, I believe, about that Council from Jim. Who are the members, and how does the Council function?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The members of the Council are representatives from the Confederation and from those vibratory levels of your inner planes bearing responsibility for your third density. The names are not important because there are no names. Your mind/body/spirit complexes request names and so, in many cases, the vibratory sound complexes which are consonant with the vibratory distortions of each entity are used. However, the name concept is not part of the Council. If names are requested, we will attempt them. However, not all have chosen names.  
  
In number, the Council that sits in constant session, though varying in its members by means of balancing, which takes place, what you would call irregularly, is **nine**. That is the Session Council. To back up this Council, there are twenty-four entities which offer their services as requested. These entities faithfully watch and have been called the Guardians.  
  
The Council operates by means of, what you would call, telepathic contact with the oneness or unity of the **nine**, the distortions blending harmoniously so that the Law of One prevails with ease. When a need for thought is present, the Council retains the distortion-complex of this need, balancing it as described, and then recommends what it considers as appropriate action. This includes: One, the duty of admitting social memory complexes to the Confederation; Two, offering aid to those who are unsure how to aid the social memory complex requesting aid in a way consonant with both the call, the Law, and the number of those calling (that is to say, sometimes the resistance of the call); Three, internal questions in the Council are determined.  
  
These are the prominent duties of the Council. They are, if in any doubt, able to contact the twenty-four who then offer consensus/judgment/thinking to the Council. The Council then may reconsider any question.

[39.9](https://www.lawofone.info/s/39#9) **Questioner:** I see. “The **Nine**” describe themselves as the “**nine** principals of God.” Can you tell me what they mean by that?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is also a veiled statement. The attempt is made to indicate that the **nine** who sit upon the Council are those representing the Creator, the One Creator, just as there may be **nine** witnesses in a courtroom testifying for one defendant. The term principal has this meaning also.  
  
The desire of the scribe may be seen in much of this material to have affected the manner of its presentation just as the abilities and preferences of this group determine the nature of this contact. The difference lies in the fact that we are as we are. Thus we may either speak as we will or not speak at all. This demands a very tuned, shall we say, group.

I first bought this book while going through a course around 2021 or so

https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Living-Lemuria-Balancing-Nutrition/dp/B084DH5KJ6

This was my first experience with anything that was channeled. 
It took me a while to be willing to actually buy it and check it out.
After making fun of it to my co-worker, look at this crazy lady who thinks she is from a lost continent called "Lemuria," he stopped me for a moment and told me that was a real thing and to look it up.
I did, although I was still a bit skeptical, given that from time to time he would argue with persistence that the Earth was flat, and Michelle Obama was a man. 
Ultimately things are so strange in this world, I truly don't know. 
When I got the book and began going through it, something really strange started happening. 
It was as though I just started downloading all of the information that was in the book.
I don't know how to explain it.
I was already moving towards plant based stuff, thinking it was cool, and it felt somewhat good, but this book began to give me a full understanding of the higher dimensional aspects which went into nutrition and diet. 
It felt like I was tripping on some sort of psychedelic or something when I was reading it, I would get through a few pages and then get lost in my mind thinking about the topics it was discussing. 
I was having all sorts of, what I would refer to now as "activations."
Now I would say that some of it is a little bit give or take, I'm not going to claim that this is some sort of perfect channeled text we need to print out for everybody in the planet to read.
I will however say that within this book, I was able to connect to some sort of guiding force which seemed to inspire within me a profound importance upon what it is that I was consuming, and ultimately guided me towards a plant based diet. 
It seemed as though I had to rip of this band-aid and addiction to the consumption of animal flesh if I truly wanted to be "enlightened."
I felt as though, in some of my psychedelic trips prior, that I had connected to something. 
Some sort of force or field that was incredibly intelligent and knew me better than I could understand myself.
When I was on the right track it was as-though this connection would be fueled and feel alive, somewhat weird(maybe crazy) but also incredibly powerful. Spirit guides I guess, but it also just felt like I was in tune with things. Synchronicities would start happening. I was doing everything that I should be. I'm living life in the manner that I know it should be lived, and I continuously enter these higher and higher states.
While reading this book, and beginning to follow its advice on becoming vegan, it was though I began to live in that state which I would previously tap into on a really good day.. or once in a while.

Unfortunately, my gung-ho attitude was actually a bit too extreme. 
To a fault, I became rigid to the philosophy - banishing certain elements from my diet instead of slowly transitioning and learning to adjust to a new lifestyle.
This caused me to become somewhat ill, losing over 20 pounds of what was already quite lean muscle, and also breaking out in hives all over my body(those damn acidic tomato's).

I was however still continuing to go up and up, but it seemed as though at times my mind began to float away from my body. It became difficult to focus, every day became more and more difficult as I became more and more sensitive.

I didn't think much of "The Nine," in relation to the books authorship, but because of all the very intense emotions and spiritual growth I was experiencing, I had to wonder. Perhaps not even real, even simply a pseudo-identity for the author (who may be a very spiritually intelligent person) to get their mind out of the way and use this character as a way to release and let the words flow, at the same time creating a bit of an ambience around the alphabetical poetics sprouting forth from her flow-trance mind. 

It should also be noted that during this period I was completely obsessed with Hermeticism, and Hermes Trismegistus/Thoth - even thinking at times that ... well I was being guided by the fella. I mean, something was going on as I explored these ancient hermetic texts, I began to develop complete mastery of my mind and an understanding of reality that was so strong I thoroughly believed that in some way it was my destiny to be a revivalist for the tradition and figure a way to prove to people this was the truth- as quite evident from my own experience. Weird stuff started to happen, including the journey into "Lessons from a Living Lemuria"

One day, a week or so before having to put down my childhood dog and best buddy(a pretty sad time), my Dad said the word Enoch casually in some conversation about aliens or something, and for some reason, it hit me in the stomach. The word stuck with me as though some part of my soul had been waiting to hear this word and trigger a reaction within me. I immediately bought the book and began to listen to it. It felt... so strange. This Enoch fella seemed to remind me of the Hermes guy. It felt too similar, this sort of secret fringe - root of religion which nobody seems to notice - type of stuff. I had a fascination with all the alien stuff after spending a profound amount of time experimenting with DMT in years prior, becoming directly aware that - yes there is some sort of other consciousness which we are capable of establishing contact with. I wouldn't expect anyone to believe such a claim - trust me it took me nearly 100 trips for me to be able to say - okay, yep this is not just my mind making up hallucinations, something about this is profoundly phenomenal and unique - something that I would have no ability to truly comprehend or even convey to another. The same sort of emotional space that accompanied those trips is what accompanied my exploration into these other topics. It was as though, whatever I was connecting to in my experiments with psychoactive, began to seep into my day to day life, guiding me in the form of an emotional radar which I would follow. 

Eventually this led to an experience with what I believed to be a UFO, in a particularly difficult and absolutely insane week(during which my co-workers "girlfriend" was found dead in a forest overdosed on meth and fentanyl.) On the phone with my Grandmother, she was breaking the news to me about my great uncle, last brother of my Grandfather whom she was married to for over 60 years passing, I saw this little thing. It sort of showed up like it knew I was talking to Grams and would have to keep my cool.  

Eventually I got way more into the Enoch stuff. 

This trail led me to all sorts of topics. One of which, was "The Keys of Enoch by JJ and Desiree Hurtak"

Purchasing this obscure and bizarre book, I had to .... I mean.... Enoch is in the title... Even as ... excuse my language... fucking crazy as this shit it looked (every normal part of my brain is just begging me to not become another one of the spiritual lunatics that thought they were some fucking prophet of the gods, "he took too much LSD and lost discernment" type of fear) I just sort of blindly followed the feeling and got it. I didn't even really have the money to afford spending $50 on some weird E.T. book, but it felt destined in some way.

Within this book I was then exposed to the Council of 9 once again. Hmmm, okay I'm sensing a trend here.  Considering the strange experiences I have been having perhaps it's time to give some attention to this potential link.

Little did I know, the book which I had purchased at this time, [[The Ra Contact & Harvest\|The Ra Contact & Harvest]], which I would not even begin to go through for another 6
