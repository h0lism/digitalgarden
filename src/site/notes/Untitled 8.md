"The supermassive black hole behind the flare is a type of accreting, or feeding, black hole called an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Referred to as J2245+3743, this AGN is estimated to be 500 million times more massive than our Sun. It resides 10 billion light-years away in the remote universe."

"This is unlike any AGN we've ever seen."

"This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy."

	“We never would have found this rare event in the first place if it weren’t for ZTF,” “We’ve been observing the sky with ZTF for seven years now, so when we see anything flare or change, we can see what it has done in the past and how it will evolve.”

AGN J224554.84+374326.5 (6/23/47)

or just

Bhagavad Gita 

11.9

Sañjaya said: O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.

11.10-11.11

Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions. The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many divine upraised weapons. He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over His body. All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all-expanding.

11.12

If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.
