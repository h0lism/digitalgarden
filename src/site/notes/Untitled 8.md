"The supermassive black hole behind the flare is a type of accreting, or feeding, black hole called an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Referred to as J2245+3743, this AGN is estimated to be 500 million times more massive than our Sun. It resides 10 billion light-years away in the remote universe."

"This is unlike any AGN we've ever seen."

"This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy."

	“We never would have found this rare event in the first place if it weren’t for ZTF,” “We’ve been observing the sky with ZTF for seven years now, so when we see anything flare or change, we can see what it has done in the past and how it will evolve.”

AGN J224554.84+374326.5 (6/23/47)

or just

J2245+3743

for short (bus riders)

Bhagavad Gita 

11.9

Sañjaya said: O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.

11.10-11.11

Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths, unlimited eyes, unlimited wonderful visions. The form was decorated with many celestial ornaments and bore many divine upraised weapons. He wore celestial garlands and garments, and many divine scents were smeared over His body. All was wondrous, brilliant, unlimited, all-expanding.

11.12

If hundreds of thousands of suns were to rise at once into the sky, their radiance might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.

It's long 
I have forgotten 
the day 
he gave me 
the pass.

My guru

Z

he looked at me
right in the eyes
and said it
with no reservation.

You 
are
Retard.

At first I was shocked
but then tears quickly filled my eyes
I had been blessed
through trials and tribulation
we made it through
the light at the end of the tunnel
had been reached.

The lord 
has finally come
and shone his light 
upon me
on this glorious day.

Generously
the Creator
bestowed upon me
in great divine love
his most honorable title.

His teachings are very complex
and filled with different 
seemingly impossible to solve
metaphysical puzzles.
They always have been.
"Are you happy?"
Hmmm well... I guess I don....
"Why are you here?"
That's a deeply layered question I would love to get into with you for the next 45 minutes. 
"Are you cupcake?" *flamboyantly rawrs like a tiger*
Back now from my space, before soap bubbles are dispersed into your eyes, vile creature
"Are you retard?"
That's something 
I had 
just 
been 
trying 
to figure out... 

His Siddha mind powers were strong
The 5 grams of Penis Envy 
I had taken before our meeting
Lemon Tekked
I sat there for hours 
My entire life
Every friend
They were just being nice
Treating me special
It existed
The whole time
Under the surface 
Of awareness
Nobody ever told me 
They just felt sympathy 
Behind closed doors
Laughing at my toils
My confusion
They felt bad
I was charity
The mushrooms will tell you the truth
Dark thoughts
Painful emotions
Face down on the floor
In agony
I thought I was the shit...
Now I am retarded
Always was
Guess what
Okay
I love myself
Even if I am retarded
Keep saying it
I am retarded
Mushroom lesson accomplished
Now experience timeless bliss
Infinite joy...
Oh shit someone's here
Yo What up
Ahhhhh Damn 
You chose the worst time 
I just took mushrooms
My urine is defin

This guy claims to channel Zachary every Wednesday.
I did watch a lot of these videos a while back,
to see if he was actually coming through, 
if maybe I could perhaps receive a message,
him knowing I was on the other line,
but I wasn't able to tell,
if it was the real deal or not.
If I know my teacher
he is usually diving into 
stolen loaves of bread 
which he stores under his bed at this time.
