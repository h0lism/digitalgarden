When someone is overtaken by their Addiction-Shadow-Complex/wetiko, it is as if an invading alien power has taken control, beginning to steer the executive function of its host so as to fulfill its own agenda.

Oftentimes the person taken over acts in ways that are diametrically opposed to the best interests of themselves and those around them. This leads one to eventually, unless interrupted and overcome, play out what is a slow tragic life sentence, a self destructive trail of pain and anguish. 

Attempting to burn every bridge and cut off any sense of support available around them, one acts like an isolated island whose ports have been destroyed as it has been succumbed by a massive ember - water does not work here in fact it manages to perform in the same light as gasoline, making the situation worse and trailing a burst of flame back to the one attempting to extend hydraulic support.
