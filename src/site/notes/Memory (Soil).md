The brain is not a memorization machine
It’s a thinking machine
We organize our experiences in ways that allow us to make sense of the world we live in
To handle the complexities of the world without falling prey to interference, we can exploit one the brains most powerful tools for organizing information, the schema 

A schema is a kind of mental framework that allows our minds to process, organize, and interpret a great deal of information with minimal effort

The way the human brain uses schemas to construct new memories is not unlike how an architect uses a blueprint to design a house.

The map acts like the barebones of the structure , how it’s all connected. Blueprints can be reused over and over 

We can see this in all the communities with homes built from the same blueprint. 

The hippocampus enables us to index memories , for different events, where and when, not what

The way the hippocampus handles things has a side benefit
 Because the hippocampus organizes memories according to the context, recalling something from one event makes it easier to retrieve other events that happened around the same time or place, painting a fuller picture 

Stephen Curry's brilliance on the basketball court isn't just about his lightning-quick release or impeccable ball-handling; it's deeply rooted in his exceptional use of memory and schemas. He's developed a kind of basketball intelligence that allows him to anticipate and react to the game with almost preternatural speed. Curry figures out patterns that work and continues to use them

Imagine the countless hours, the years, which Curry has spent practicing on the court and studying game film at home. Each possession, each play, becomes a data point stored in his mind. These aren't just isolated fragmentary moments; they're all organized into schemas – mental frameworks that represent common basketball situations. A pick-and-roll, a fast break, a defensive rotation – Curry has seen these foundational aspects play out countless times, and his brain has built sophisticated models for how these situations typically unfold.

This vast library of schemas allows Curry to make split-second decisions with incredible accuracy. When he's on the court, he's not just reacting to what's happening in front of him; he's anticipating what's likely to happen next. He recognizes patterns, predicts opponent movements, and understands the potential consequences of every action.
