Listened to this over 150+ times
nearly everyday
I was meditating to this
on the weeks leading up to different UFO experiences
( the secret sauce has been leaked, please use responsibly )

In a self-ordained prophetically frenzied research mode, I sat questioning myself and the topic I was talking about for a second. Is this even remotely sane? Maybe I'm still clearing up some psychosis..
I then saw a familiar video sitting at 444k views in the recommendations section of the tab of YouTube which was presently opened upon the screen of my MSI GS63 Stealth Gaming Laptop, and clicked (give it a few moments, this thing is getting laggy.... time to open the Dragon Center)
 workflow completely shattered
Can't even think anymore
this is personally one of my most profound moments
 I believe I have finally re-connected with [[Prequel𓂀/3. Babaji\|3. Babaji]] 
This is like 1 trillion dollars (to me)

Although arguably, 
Steve Jobs was an enormous fan of Autobiography of a Yogi,
which is where Babaji was essentially introduced to the Western mind.
So much so, he actually had copies of the book handed out to everyone that attended his funeral. 
Apple is worth 4 trillion today.
(but unfortunately Steve Jobs only owned about .25% at the time of his death)
He owned 15% at one point, which would have made him by far, the richest man in the world. Another source claims 11%, and at that rate he would be neck and neck with Elon, only ~25-30 billion behind.

Apple alone doesn't account for the other sources of income which contributed to Jobs well earned monastery mountain. When Disney bought Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, he became a member of the company’s board of directors, and their largest shareholder, at 7.4%. Yahoo Finance claims that this was about $4.6billion worth at the time.

( I have been studying the Jewish religion, and am a big fan of it. I do not claim that second gematria result as true, but its there related to the Steve Jobs one, THAT'S IT - I do not follow politics whatsoever, or listen to anyone that talks about politics, and have absolutely no idea what is going on in that sphere. I get brief updates when riding in a vehicle with my brother, but other than that, consider me oblivious. )

This is what I'm about

In March of 1965, Elvis began photography for his 19th movie "Harum Scarum." He was one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood at the time. Even though he had found success, all the money and fame one could want, he was becoming disillusioned with the direction of his career. The King (baybayy) was seeking something that was deeper in life. His only escape from the blinding limelight, was a continuing quest for spiritual fulfillment. Strolling down the road of this infinite game(what being a prominent player in his finite world seemed to not be), Elvis's friends told him about the Lake Shrine of the Self-Realization Fellowship. He went. This is located on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles, the Pacific Palisades (Pleiades) region, and hailed as one of the county's most beautiful gardens. Spanning several acres, the destination is full of green trees, colorful flowers, and calm ponds(for pondering the nature of the Self). Paths wind wildly around koi-filled lakes, rose bushes, hibiscus, and an embalmment of tall palms, meant to bring one closer to their calm(sent away from their qualms).

When he was just 8 years old, supposedly, a UFO hovered above Elvis's childhood home. He received a vision of his future as a stage performer in a white jumpsuit, not knowing what it meant at the time. 

"His father told us he'd gone out to have a cigarette at 2am during the delivery, and when he looked up into the skies above their little shack, he saw the strangest blue light. He knew right then and there that something special was happening."

Songs by Elvis - G.I. Blues, Blue Hawaii, Blue Christmas, and ... 

![Pasted image 20251118183312.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251118183312.png)

Elvis claimed to see two UFO's as an adult, as-well. One while driving through the desert, and another hovering above Graceland about a year later. 

The musician's encounter with extraterrestrial life shaped his beliefs, even though he did not really understand what it meant as a child. He once shared with friend Wanda June Hill: "I am not of this world."

UFO-spotting and Elvis-spotting became somewhat synonymous with certain sections of the press.

"Amara (अमर) represents the number 33 (thirty-three) in the “word-numeral system” (_bhūtasaṃkhyā_), which was used in Sanskrit texts dealing with astronomy, mathematics, metrics, as well as in the dates of inscriptions and manuscripts in ancient Indian literature.—A system of expressing numbers by means of words arranged as in the place-value notation was developed and perfected in India in the early centuries of the Christian era. In this system the numerals [e.g., 33—_amara_] are expressed by names of things, beings or concepts, which, naturally or in accordance with the teaching of the Śāstras, connote numbers."

"Amara (अमर) or “immortal” refers to one of the 46 qualities of the soul to be meditated on in the “Practice of Meditation on Liberated Souls (Siddhas)”, according to Jain texts like Ācārāṅga (5.6.123-140), Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama (13.5.4.31) and Samayasāra (1.49).—The pure soul can be recognised by meditation on its true nature, represented by the liberated souls of the Siddhas. The practice which leads to this realisation is meditation on the fact that attachment, aversion, passions and the influx of karmas, are ‘not mine’, that I am separate from them and consist of infinite knowledge, perception, conduct, spiritual energy, that I am the pure, enlightened, and everlasting soul. The qualities of the soul to be meditated on as truly mine are: [e.g., My soul is immortal (amara)] [...] The meditation on such extended fourty-five qualities of the pure soul presents the niśacaya-naya, which is aligned with Kundakunda’s approach."
