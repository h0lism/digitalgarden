Dr. Caroline Leaf is a PhD communication pathologist and clinical neuroscientist who specializes in the intersection of psycho-neurobiology(mind-brain-body) and metacognitive(thinking about thinking) neuropsychology(brain activity and behavior). With the fancy jargon out of the way, what is it she actually does? Since the early 1980s, Mrs. Leaf has dived in the fascinating terrain of the mind-brain connection, the nature of mental health, and the formation of memory. Caroline was one of the first in her field to study how the brain can change (neuroplasticity) from directed mind input (managing your thinking). During her years of clinical practice and work with underprivileged teachers and students across South Africa, she developed her theory (called the Geodesic Information Processing theory) of how we think, build memory, and learn, into tools and processes. By sharing her findings with others, Caroline has helped to transform the lives of thousands of individuals suffering from learning disabilities: ADD, ADHD, autism, dementias, and mental ill-health issues such as PTSD, anxiety and depression. She’s assisted people with traumatic brain injury — those who other medical professionals had written off as permanently disabled — to not only recover from their injuries, but excel (in areas like academics, where highly functioning brain power is a prerequisite). 

Her research explores the concept of "toxic thoughts" and their negative impact on brain health and wellbeing. She advocates for managing our thought life through techniques like mindfulness, cognitive reframing, self-reflection, and most notably her 5 step Neurocycle process.

A mind that is filled with toxic, depressing, or anxious thoughts - it’s in a messy state. In the same way that you manage your garden so it doesn’t get overwhelmed with weeds, we need to manage our mind so the flowers have room to get sunshine and blossom. When Lil John said, in 2010, "Get outta your mind," we seemed to, as a species, have taken this far too literally. Outrageously dangerous levels of crunk have perpetrated our world ever since. In turn, this has led to the disastrous worldly conditions we find ourselves in now. Luckily, Caroline has some neat information to help us get back *into* our mind, look around, see what is in there, and perhaps get started in cleaning up what we find.

What's in a Thought?

The mind contains trillions and trillions of thoughts. These are real physical things that occupy space within our brain and mind. A thought begins to etch itself into your brain as you use your mind - as you think, feel and make decisions. Each time the brain is stimulated by your mind it responds in many different ways including electromagnetic, neurochemical, and even genetic changes. It moves in step with your mind's activity. Constant mental chatter isn't just noise; it's the brain's way of processing situations, emotions, and decisions. With every experience you have, in every moment of every day, with every breath you take, every step you make, your mind is watching you, working as your brain is changing. Recent researchers have given a name to this aspect of mental activity and termed it "thought worms." These thought worms represent the transitions between different thoughts in our minds, the dynamic nature of our thinking process. On average, it's estimated that we experience around 6,200 of these thought transitions every day. We are constantly shifting from one idea to the next. You might as well direct this mind process of constant thought building to your advantage. Understanding and influencing these transitions can be a powerful tool in shaping our mental landscape. We can learn to control our mind, therefore becoming the architects of our brain, and, by extension, our lives. The knowledge of neuroplasticity is a gift from the heavens. 

The wiring inside of the brain ends up looking like trees, and in the neuroscience world are referred to as having an arbor-like structure. Inside of this structure are the embedded memories, which there can be any number of in a single thought. Thousands upon thousands of memories can contribute to a single thought, in the same way that a tree can have thousands of branches.

![[Brain-trees.jpg\|Brain-trees.jpg]]
Made up of dendrites, a thought tree itself is a concept, the big idea. Each "branch" of the tree represents a smaller component of the larger thought. These branches are formed by neurons and their connections (synapses) in the brain and symbolize the ties between different aspects of a thought or concept. They are pathways that link various related memories or ideas, creating a comprehensive network of understanding. In the same way that a root system is organized so that a plant is able to absorb as much water and nutrients as possible, your memories intertwine so that you have a conceptual repository built with as much detail as possible that you can retrieve information from. New information integrates into our existing network of knowledge by forming associations with established concepts. This interconnected web of associations helps us retrieve and use information more efficiently. Thinking of one concept, you access related memories or ideas.

A thought is a cluster of information, a cluster of memories. What are memories? There are two main divisions that we can separate memories into.

The first is source memories. Like the roots of a plant, these are the initial experience, the origin story. Right now at this very moment, you have little protein structures that are forming in correlation with your exposure to these words and the information that they contain. 

After that we have interpretation memories, which we could say are the branches that grow outwardly from the source memory. These show up secondary, as you think, feel, choose, and go about your life. This is the impact that the source experience has had on your life. How you interpret things can change overtime. 

Furthermore you divide memories into another 3 additional categories. 

1. Informational memories
	1. All the details. Particulars, facts, data, associations, links and whatever else is associated with that thought. These are akin to the branches of a thought tree.
2. Emotional memories 
	1. The feelings that are associated with the informational memories. These could be seen as the leaves on the branches of a thought tree.  
3. Physical memories 
	1. Embodiments of the sensations experienced at the time the thought was built, which are coupled with the emotional memories and informational memories. The physical impact and manifestations of our thoughts and experiences in the brain and body. This includes the physical changes in brain structures and patterns as a result of learning, trauma, and repetitive thought processes.

How are memories formed? 

Caroline does a remarkable job at teaching the formation of memory in relation to the Parable of the Sower (or the Seed)

The Parable of the Sower, found in the Bible. describes a sower who scatters seeds, which fall on different types of soil: the path, rocky places, thorns, and good soil. The seed that falls on good soil grows and yields a crop, while the others either fail to take root or are choked out.

In Carolines's interpretation, the "seed" represents the information or experiences we encounter. 

- When the mind (good soil) is receptive, information (the seed) can take root and grow into strong memories (like the crop in the parable). This growth represents the formation and strengthening of neural pathways. If the soil is not conducive (like the rocky or thorny soil), the information may not be properly encoded or may be easily forgotten or distorted, similar to how seeds fail to grow in poor soil conditions.

What is the mind?

Most of the time, when people think of the brain, they think of the mind as though it were the same thing. They are not identical. The mind works through the brain and body, it is a force which energizes the other two to function. Mind drives the brain and actively affects it. When you're dead it doesn't work. It is your aliveness. Your ability to experience existence. Behind the scenes it's working through electromagnetic waves, gravitational fields, quantum energy, space-time energy, aromatic rings etc. Caroline even relates the mind to the soul / spirit. 
# Divisions of The Mind
### Conscious

The conscious mind is the smallest portion of the mind and is responsible for your present moment experience. It is also the slowest, processing only about 2,000 bits of information per second. This is where conscious action takes place and is only in operation when we're awake. Fully aware, this part of the mind is intentional, functions best when we are deliberate, actively self-regulated, and proactive. It's important to note that it can be incredibly difficult to truly, fully enter just the present moment, as it is somewhat out of time. Here lies a place where our present, the amalgamation of the past and the road to the future all intertwine into a single instance and bid for attention. You may not be fully aware of it, but the non-conscious is consistently bringing the past into the present and looking to plan for the future as-well. The conscious mind is what navigates these waters and is incredibly important in terms of steering through the seas vs. being thrown around by them.
### Subconscious

The subconscious mind could be thought of like a highway between the great reserve of information stored within our non-conscious mind and the presently situated conscious. Experiences we are having in the present moment are consistently being driven into the non-conscious, actively changing us in real time, while simultaneously we have information from the non-conscious coming into the present moment coloring it with information from the past. We need to use our conscious mind to pay attention to what is happening within our subconscious mind so that we can become aware of what our nonconscious mind is bringing forward. This material could perhaps be showing up in the form of intrusive thoughts or difficult emotions; which if you follow the trail, will lead you to a certain insight about yourself in relation to a particular environment or element of life. It could also be helpful information which is beneficial to your present moment, wisdom from the past, showing up in efforts to provide you the necessary intelligence to navigate a situation to the best of your ability. It's that tip of the tongue feeling. The subconscious is a bridge, it's a portal. Nothing is stored here. Think of the auto-suggestion on your phone that gives suggestions as you type. 
### Non-conscious

The non-conscious is the largest and fastest part of the 3 divisions of mind and is where all of our experiences, memories and thoughts are stored. Good and bad, this high energy powerhouse is the container for everything we have been exposed to and is active 24 hours a day. It’s always online working with the conscious while the conscious mind is awake, and is in constant conversation with the subconscious mind working to bring balance. Beyond space and time, like a quantum super computer; it stores memories from the past, plans for the future, and is directly influenced and actively affected by the observers perspective. Containing all of our memories, embedded with their informational, emotional, and physical aspects, rummaging through our non-conscious can teleport us through time. It connects us to a deeply spiritual and phenomenally fast quantum world. Here lies the real you, where your truth, values, intelligence, wisdom, and meaning are derived from an accumulated reservoir of life experience. Think of it like an informational bubble where the entirety of your memories are stored in a swirling mass of energy. It acts as the source of our intuition and is dynamically regulated by a process which affects our communication and behavior. The non-conscious is like a record library that holds everything from the past in storage that we can draw from. It is, however, malleable. We can go back and alter the perspective we have on events and consciously change the effect that history is actively having on us. We hold veto power over our perspective of things and can choose whether or not allowing them to affect us in the same way they have previously is what we want. When you are consciously engaging with the non-conscious mind through deliberate, intentional, strategic, and proactive deep thinking, you can draw your thoughts with their embedded memories, through the subconscious(like a straw) into the conscious. When they arrive in the conscious mind they are in a malleable state and have the ability to be changed, reconceptualized to another perspective, before being placed back into the filing cabinet. You can alter the records and therefore begin to take the cascade effect they have on your life. You have veto power over how it affects you. Take a sharpie, cross out the title and change it to something else. You override the force generated from the energy of the toxic thought and shift it to, whenever stimulated, generate positive energy instead. Typically it was thought that the conscious mind was where all processing took place, but truly, the non-conscious is where our super-computer powers reside. It will bring us what we need to know or look at throughout the day and organize our thoughts to bring us there like a Spotify que. This part of the mind processes 400 billion bits of information per second.
### Unconscious
When we are asleep, knocked out, or under anesthesia. 

So.... how is it that we can eliminate stress, anxiety, depression and toxic thinking? Realizing that the unsavory emotions we experience and thoughts we have are stemming from things we have tucked away in the recesses of our nonconscious gives us clarity as to what the next step is - go within. By knowing what to do with those suppressed and undealt with things that we’ve kept hidden, often for far too long, we can actually begin to heal once and for all. Here we are turning the tide on what has been wreaking havoc on our brain, body, and relationships. You get into the dirt until you can find the original root from which things stem, develop an understanding of the nonconscious elements that are activating this discomfort within you, and then consciously install an anti-virus program that embraces, processes, and reconceptualizes what is shooting out SOS signals. You learn to control your thoughts instead of letting them control you. This is called mind management, the art of consciously directing and shaping the thoughts and emotions that flow through you. If you don't find some way to reconceptualize the toxic thoughts you are experiencing, they will continuously loop through you. No matter how hard you try to escape or ignore them, they will have nowhere else to go except out into your behaviors and emotions or into your body. 

There is an old Zen story that illustrates the importance of managing our minds. 

One day, a sage gives to his disciple an empty sack, and a basket full of potatoes. 

"Think of all the people who have done or said something against you in the past, especially those you cannot forgive. For each of them, inscribe their name on a potato and put it in the sack. Return back to me in a week.” 

The disciple was able to come up with quite a few names as he filled the bag. Soon he had a heavy load to carry around. At first, he didn’t think much of it. The sack wasn’t too debilitating and he was able to make it through his days just fine. After a while though, it began to become more of a burden. The bag of spuds sometimes got in the way of things and ultimately seemed to require more effort to carry as time went on, even though it’s weight remained the same. Soon a smell began to develop. The potato’s had begun to go bad and gave off a ripe odor. Not only were his arms becoming increasingly sore, but now the bag was becoming rather unpleasant. Finally the week was over and the disciple returned to the sage. 

“So, what did you learn?” 

At once the disciple told the master about how he realized that holding on to grudges only brought negative things to his life. 

"When we are unable to forgive others, we carry negative feelings with us everywhere, which become increasingly heavy, much like these potatoes. That negativity becomes a burden to us and, after a while, it festers."

The sage smiled.
"Good, so how can we lighten the load?”

“We must strive to forgive.”

“Forgiving someone is equivalent to removing the corresponding potato from the sack. How many of your transgressors are you able to forgive?”

“I’ve thought about it quite a bit,” the disciple said. “It required much effort, but I have decided to forgive them all.”

“Very well, we can remove all the potatoes."

The Sage pulled out another basket of potato's out from under the stool he was sitting on. 

"Now, why don't we put some in for all of the new people you feel transgressed you during this week."

"Don't shoot the messenger"

# The 5 Step Neurocycle Process

check back next week lol 

We cannot control events
We cannot control circumstances
We cannot control people
But we can control how we respond to the situations life throws at us
However ...  we aren't always perfect. 
It's normal for us to have a difficult time with the hands we are dealt, in some cases it would be abnormal not to.. 
The good news is that our biology is equipped to handle this.
Stress is normal and can be catalyst for us to learn new things and grow, but distress is just downright uncomfortable.
If we stay in this pain, where stress is severe and prolonged, the negative energy it holds will eat us from the inside out. Accumulatively over time, the vulnerability of our brain and body will become impaired right down to the level of our DNA. 
Knowing the ways in which neuroplasticity works empowers us with the ability to clean things up and improve our situation.
We aren't broken or cursed to a fragmented experience of life. We don't have to sit in a garden drowning in weeds. A pill, in most circumstances, is a band-aid. 
As long as we embrace, process, and reconceptualize our challenges, we can navigate our way through them.
