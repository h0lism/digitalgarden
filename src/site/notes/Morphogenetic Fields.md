 Proposed by the Biologist Rupert Sheldrake, the theory suggests that all living organisms are guided by invisible fields that influence their development and behavior. It holds the idea that these fields can be influenced by the collective experience of similar organisms across time and space (morphic resonance).

These could potentially be linked to the different planetary structures of our galaxy. Within 


The "Buddhic-field," the field of unity - oneness and unconditional love.
What we think of as Christ, unconditional love, could this simply be a field of vibration, one of a higher dimensional origin, of which we attune to internally, and perhaps even originally stem from?
This may be a very difficult perspective, especially in our world which offers so many opportunities to disconnect from, but perhaps that's part of the challenge, and also the reward for spiritual work. 

One unified field of consciousness

Resonating, attunement 

Sheldrake's "resonance" might explain how octopuses achieve such astonishing intelligence without any contact between parents and offspring

The Taoist concept of _Wu Wei_ (effortless action) mirrors morphic fields’ self-organizing nature
